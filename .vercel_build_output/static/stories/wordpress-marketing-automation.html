You can use the Yoast SEO plugin for WordPress. The first thing it does is help you optimize your content for Google and other search engines. And that’s not all! It also enables you to optimize your content for readability.</p><p>When it comes to <strong>keyword optimization</strong>, Yoast offers a built-in keyword analysis tool that scans your page or post title and content and suggests changes to improve your SEO score for a chosen keyword.</p><p>In terms of automating SEO, you can choose to change your settings in bulk. For example, you can change meta titles and descriptions without having to edit each page one by one.</p><p>Simply go to the Tools section and click on “Bulk Editor.” You’ll have access to a dashboard that includes all your pages, and you can simply change the titles and descriptions one by one.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/DRVJbC9zec00BTf0iopLqavi0Q8VZMT-Jsh1MyXyhutJdZOk0WpHL7vXeb8JdjnGDGEOdQJnh1UM9tCIAcTiWVY3qlKm4dGppOVARMP4FyQWDWnGFoSMC3czNKsvQFPdNA2gfj1DQslLjK3rhA" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy"></figure><h3 id="marketing-automation-tools-dont-have-to-be-complicated">Marketing automation tools don't have to be complicated!</h3><p>We could fork over a large sum of our hard-earned cash in the name of convenience and future proofing. But is that really necessary? If there are plenty of other tools available to help your site with marketing automation, why not just use them?</p><p>In case you hadn't realized it yet: WordPress isn’t very beginner-friendly when it comes to marketing automation unless you are strategic about which plugins you choose to use. There's no built-in way to update your posts or schedule pages for email outreach automatically; for example, you have to do everything yourself manually. And when it comes to lead generation and sales funnels made up of multiple steps, WordPress is hardly the most efficient tool around.</p><p>It's also essential to keep a healthy WordPress installation while working on automation. It's easy to keep adding plugins and features and find yourself with a bloated setup. To learn more about a healthy WordPress build, check out our <a href="https://www.weblime.com/stories/the-ultimate-wordpress-guide">Ultimate WordPress Guide</a>.</p><p>Thankfully, that's all about to change with some great new tools from the world's leading marketing automation providers like HubSpot and ActiveCampaign. With these advanced plugins integrated into your WordPress site, you can start automating more of your marketing efforts—without having to do anything at all!</p><!-- HTML_TAG_END --></div>
