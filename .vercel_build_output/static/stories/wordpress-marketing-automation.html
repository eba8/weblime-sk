But is that really necessary? If there are plenty of other tools available to help your site with marketing automation, why not just use them?</p><p>In case you hadn't realized it yet: WordPress isn’t very beginner-friendly when it comes to marketing automation unless you are strategic about which plugins you choose to use. There's no built-in way to update your posts or schedule pages for email outreach automatically; for example, you have to do everything yourself manually. And when it comes to lead generation and sales funnels made up of multiple steps, WordPress is hardly the most efficient tool around.</p><p>It's also essential to keep a healthy WordPress installation while working on automation. It's easy to keep adding plugins and features and find yourself with a bloated setup. To learn more about a healthy WordPress build, check out our <a href="https://www.weblime.com/stories/the-ultimate-wordpress-guide">Ultimate WordPress Guide</a>.</p><p>Thankfully, that's all about to change with some great new tools from the world's leading marketing automation providers like HubSpot and ActiveCampaign. With these advanced plugins integrated into your WordPress site, you can start automating more of your marketing efforts—without having to do anything at all!</p><!-- HTML_TAG_END --></div>

It can be a scary step, but it will feel more\\nlike a comfortable step into the future if you have the right tools, like the\\nright blogging platform.\\n\\nYou might not know how important it is to choose the right blogging platform for\\nyour photography business. The truth is—when you publish photos on different\\nplatforms like Instagram or Facebook, only a tiny percentage of viewers actually\\nsee them. And when viewers do see them, they’re often fed more, so it’s hard for\\nthem to keep up with everything you’ve done, which leaves them feeling\\ndisconnected from your work.\\n\\nA blog is different from these other platforms because it is all about building\\nan online presence on your website. Your blog\\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog] will be constantly updated with new content\\nto help your audience connect with what you have to share.

One of the best ways to get\\n   noticed is to have your work seen by as many people as possible—and with a\\n   blog, you can easily do that.\\n * Build your brand and gain exposure. Blogging is a great way to increase\\n   traffic to your website, grow your social media following, and improve SEO\\n   for your website or business.\\n * Connect with like-minded people and build a community. Building relationships\\n   within the photography community is one of the best ways to stay inspired,\\n   grow as an artist, improve your photography skills and knowledge, find\\n   clients, and generally enjoy being part of a supportive network where you can\\n   share ideas.\\n * Share your knowledge and expertise. As well as helping you connect with other\\n   photographers, you can use blogging as a platform for sharing what you know\\n   about photography with others—and when they see how much value they're\\n   getting from reading what you write, they'll be more likely to want to come\\n   back for more!\\n\\nBest blogging platforms for photographers\\nWordPress is the most popular blogging platform for photographers. It offers a\\nhigh degree of flexibility, including the ability to customize your site's\\ndesign, add plugins, and integrate an online store.

In its free starter plan, you also get\\n   unlimited storage space, which is ideal for photographers with large files\\n   that take up more storage space than text-heavy sites.

Moreover,\\nthe photographer’s portfolio could live on different platforms, making it hard\\nto decide which link to send to a potential client.\\n\\nThe problem with this solution is that there is no way for clients to easily get\\na sense of what kind of work the photographer does and how they could\\npotentially help them.\\n\\nThat's why we created Limey [https://limey.io/]. Limey is a landing page builder\\nthat helps photographers easily create digital business cards for their relevant\\nportfolios (e.g., Shutterstock, Behance). Limey allows photographers to add\\nlinks to their existing online portfolios and populate their landing pages with\\nlinks to any websites they want to refer clients to. Clients will be able to\\nvisit these pages and immediately get an idea of what kind of services or\\nproducts a specific photographer offers.\\n\\nPick the right blogging platform to save time, energy, and effort so that you\\ncan focus on what's important.\\nOne of the most important decisions you’ll make as a blogger is choosing a\\nblogging platform. The right blogging platform for your needs can help you save\\ntime, energy, and effort to focus on what’s important – putting your best foot\\nforward.\\n\\nThe following are some of the criteria we recommend thinking about when choosing\\nyour photography blog platform:\\n\\n * Ease of use – an easy to use interface will save you time and money. You\\n   won’t have to spend hours learning how to use it or fork over big bucks for\\n   someone else to do it for you. Some popular platforms may seem easy at first\\n   glance, but they can become complicated if customization is needed once you\\n   dig deeper.\\n * Features – Is there room to grow? Can the platform evolve with your changing\\n   needs? Does it allow plugins or themes that will help expand its\\n   capabilities? Will it provide everything you need now and in the future?\\n * Branding – Does the platform allow complete control over your content and\\n   branding? If branding matters to you, then choose carefully. Some platforms\\n   add watermarks and links back to themselves and control what content goes on\\n   your site. Avoid these unless this is acceptable to you.\\n\\nYou now have a pretty good idea of what you should be looking for in a\\nphotography blog platform.\\n\\nThe most important thing to remember is that the perfect platform doesn't exist.\\nYou need to pick one that will allow you to focus on what's really important:\\nyour photography.\",\"excerpt\":\"We reviewed the top photography blog platforms on the market.

Marketing\\nautomation tools are supposed to help you prioritize and handle the many\\ndifferent pieces of your online campaigns. eCommerce companies are growing in\\nnumber at an astonishing rate, and separating yourself from your competitors\\nrequires a well-planned out strategy.\\n\\nAttracting new users and converting them into paying customers is a top priority\\nfor every eCommerce business. But once you’ve given them your product, how can\\nyou make sure they come back?\\n\\nYou’ll need to analyze your website's metrics, keep track of visitors,\\ncommunicate with potential customers, and the list goes on.\\n\\nThis article will cover the principles of eCommerce marketing automation and how\\nit can make your life easier while your business grows to new levels.\\n\\nWhat is eCommerce marketing automation?\\nEcommerce marketing automation refers to software built to automate repetitive\\nmarketing tasks. This includes following up with leads, sending e-mails, and\\ncollecting information.\\n\\nAutomating your eCommerce marketing can help you free up time by creating and\\nlaunching campaigns. The days when you had to hire people for mundane tasks are\\nlong gone. Developers and companies have created software that will remove the\\nblood, sweat, and tears from repetitive tasks so you can focus on other aspects\\nof your business.\\n\\nWhat does eCommerce marketing automation include?\\nAutomation takes care of marketing and sales engagement while driving \\nmeasurable\\nresults [https://www.weblime.com/stories/ecommerce-dashboard]. It allows you to\\neasily design, execute, and automate your campaigns or tasks across multiple\\ndepartments. You can simultaneously scale up your marketing efforts while\\nachieving a consistent customer experience.\\n\\nAutomation software comes in many different forms. Some simplify workflows,\\nwhile others tackle analysis. Let's take a closer look at four of the most\\nvaluable types of automation software.\\n\\nMarketing Automation Software\\n\\nMarketing automation software is all about simplifying and streamlining your\\nmarketing processes. For example, you can use it to automate repetitive tasks\\nlike email campaigns. Marketing automation tools\\n[https://www.weblime.com/stories/shopify-automation] also help track and analyze\\nmarketing and sales data to easily get a big picture view of all your marketing\\nendeavors.\\n\\nWorkflow automation\\n\\nHigh-volume retailers often use workflow automation tools to ensure their orders\\nare processed efficiently. Workflow automation software can automatically update\\nsystems when orders are shipped or returned, track inventory, and make sure\\ncustomers are billed correctly. Some workflow automation tools can also make\\nrecommendations based on past performance and projected demand.\\n\\nCustomer Relationship Management (CRM) Software\\n\\nCRM software deals with customer interactions on an individual level. This is\\nwhere you'll find information about customers' details, contact information, and\\norder histories. It also allows you to send personalized emails, messages, and\\npromotions to specific customers based on their actions or data. Because of\\nthis, CRM helps improve customer relations significantly by assisting companies\\nin sending the right message to the right person at the right time.\\n\\nWeb Analytics Software\\n\\nWeb Analytics is where you find data about how visitors interact with your\\nwebsite or online store. Tracking metrics like bounce rate, page views per\\nvisit, and time on site are essential for understanding which pages are working\\nbest and which ones need improvement. With data from web analytics software, you\\ncan calculate how well your campaigns are performing and how good your website’s\\nUI/UX is.\\n\\nBest eCommerce Automation Tools\\nNow that you know the main categories of eCommerce marketing automation its time\\nto have a closer look at some of the best tools out there.\\n\\nEmail Marketing Automation Tools\\n\\nTo recap, email marketing automation is a way to deliver emails to customers\\nbased on their behaviors. You can also segment users based on demographics, such\\nas age, location, or behavior.\\n\\nSome examples of email marketing automation include:\\n\\nAbandoned Cart Emails\\n\\nMany users tend to add a product to their carts and never really finish the\\ncheckout process. They might want to save their cart for later, but they simply\\nforget about it in most cases.\\n\\nInstead of losing these customers, you can set up an abandoned cart email\\ncampaign that will automatically send out a message reminding users about the\\nproducts they never really purchased. This can help you increase sales for an\\nextremely low cost, and it’s all automatic.\\n\\nCross-sell and Upsell Emails\\n\\nAfter users purchase a product from your store, they will most likely receive a\\nconfirmation email. This is usually autogenerated by the eCommerce platform you\\nare using. But after they get this initial email, most people never hear back\\nfrom the store they just purchased from.\\n\\nA cross-sell or upsell email campaign automatically sends out a message to your\\nprevious customers so they can come back and buy again. When you set up such a\\ncampaign, you want to make sure that you also include an incentive (like a\\ndiscount coupon) so people will be more likely to reorder from your store.\\n\\nRemember, previous customers are more likely to purchase from you than new\\nusers. This happens because they already trust your business and know that there\\nis nothing to worry about.\\n\\nCustomer Engagement Emails\\n\\nIf your store allows users to create an account, you should have a bunch of\\nuseful information about them. Customer engagement emails are a great way to\\nstrengthen the relationship between your business and users by sending them a\\n“Happy Birthday” message with a special discount.\\n\\nBuilding this relationship will turn customers into brand advocates who will\\nrecommend your store to their friends and family.\\n\\nPromotional Emails\\n\\nSay you have ordered a large quantity of a specific product because your\\nsupplier had a great offer. You now decide to run a campaign and apply a\\ndiscount to that particular product or category.\\n\\nThe best and cheapest way to boost your sales is to set up a promotional email\\ncampaign and let everyone on your list know about your offer.\\n\\nOn the other hand, if your stock runs low on a product and you want to get rid\\nof it to buy its new variant, you can send out a message to your list letting\\nthem know about it.\\n\\nKlaviyo [https://www.klaviyo.com/] - most accessible email marketing automation\\ntool\\nKlaviyo helps e‑commerce businesses collect, analyze and use customer data to\\noptimize marketing strategies and maximize revenue. The platform allows\\ncompanies to send personalized email marketing campaigns to customers.\\n\\nThe best thing about Klaviyo is that it comes with predefined automation\\ntemplates that work out of the box. Let’s have a look at how you can set up your\\nfirst Welcome Series flow.\\n\\nOnce you sign in to Klaviyo, you will see the following screen:\\n\\nNext, you’ll have to click on the Flows menu item on the left side of the page.\\nFlows are automations that will do the heavy lifting of email marketing for you.\\n\\nKlaviyo lets you create separate Lists based on multiple criteria.\\n\\nFor example, you can create a list of:\\n\\n * People that have ordered a specific product;\\n * New users that have signed up to your newsletter;\\n * Existing customers that have purchased from you more than two times.\\n\\nThe possibilities are endless here, but for this example, I am going to consider\\nyou simply having the default “New Subscribers” list.\\n\\nYou will have to click on the “Get Started” button right below the “Welcome\\nEmail” card on the Flows screen.\\n\\nOnce you do that, you’ll see this screen:\\n\\nGo ahead and select your list, then click on continue.\\n\\nThe Flow editor will open up, and it looks like this:\\n\\nBy default, Klaviyo has already added three steps to this Flow:\\n\\n 1. When a new email gets added to your database, it will instantly receive a\\n    Welcome Message.\\n 2. After three days from the previous email, that address will receive an\\n    additional message.\\n 3. After four days from the previous email, that address will receive the last\\n    message in this sequence.\\n\\nNow you want to write and design these emails. You’ll have to click on the first\\nemail box, then click edit on the panel on the left.\\n\\nNow you’ll see a screen that allows you to edit the sender’s name and email\\naddress, subject line, and preview text. Once you complete these fields, you can\\nclick on the “Edit Content” button to take you to the email content editor page.\\n\\nAfter creating the first email, you can click on the “Save Content” button. This\\nwill take you back to the previous page and save all your progress.\\n\\nClick “Done” in the top right corner, and you’ll be taken back to the initial\\nFlow page.\\n\\nThe last step you have to take is to set your first email as “Live.” To do so,\\nclick on the “Draft” text on the bottom left of the email card and select\\n“Live.”\\n\\nCongratulations! You just configured your first email that will be sent\\nautomatically by Klaviyo when a new email address gets added to your list.\\n\\nNow you have to follow the same steps to finish the other two emails. Once you\\nare done, you can click on the “Save & Exit” button in the top right corner:\\n\\nTo make sure your Flow works, look for a small green dot besides its name in the\\nFlows screen:\\n\\nNow that you have your first Flow, it's time to configure more! After all, you\\nwant to automate every aspect of your email marketing efforts completely.\\n\\nClick on the blue “Create Flow” button in the top right corner of the screen.\\n\\nAs I previously mentioned, Klaviyo provides a vast template library you can pick\\nFlows from.\\n\\nKlaviyo is a truly comprehensive email marketing tool that can even automate SMS\\ncampaigns. Because it has so many features, you might feel lost at first, but\\nwith time and a few tutorials, you’ll get the hang of it in no time.\\n\\nAnother email marketing tool you can use is Mailchimp. The great thing about it\\nis that it also acts like a CRM (Customer Relationship Management) platform.\\n\\nMailchimp [https://mailchimp.com/] - an all in one sales automation tool\\nMailchimp is an easy-to-use marketing automation platform for SMBs. You can\\ncreate and send email newsletters, manage your subscriber lists, and track\\ncampaign performance.\\n\\nWith Mailchimp, you can automate tasks like welcoming new subscribers,\\nre-engaging inactive customers, and following up with people after they buy\\nsomething. The platform makes it easy to connect with your audience across\\nvarious channels—email, web, mobile, and more—so you can market smarter and grow\\nfaster.\\n\\nMailChimp has many tools to help your business grow, so you can stay organized,\\nreach customers wherever they are, sell more stuff, and boost your bottom line.\\n\\nCreate Signup Forms\\n\\nGet new subscribers from anywhere on the web, with forms that match the look and\\nfeel of your brand.\\n\\nAnalyze Your Audience Segments\\n\\nSee which groups of subscribers are opening and clicking on emails, so you can\\nfigure out who to send more stuff to.\\n\\nSend the Right Messages to the Right People\\n\\nQuickly target segments like first-time buyers or people who abandoned their\\ncarts to make sure you're constantly sending relevant messages.\\n\\nCompared to Klaviyo, Mailchimp might feel a bit more complicated for first-time\\nusers.\\n\\nNow that you know how to automate your email campaigns is time to look at how\\nyou can integrate this part of your marketing strategy with your store’s\\ninventory. This will not only help your cash flow, but it will open up new\\npossibilities you haven’t even thought of.\\n\\nWorkflow automation\\n\\nWorkflow automation software is designed to streamline manual processes. For\\nexample, your inventory management system needs to interact with both systems if\\nyou sell products through your eCommerce website and your brick-and-mortar\\nstore.\\n\\nWorkflow automation software can ensure that inventory quantities in both\\nsystems are always correct by performing updates in real-time.\\n\\nAutomate.io [http://automate.io] - Connect your cloud apps\\nAautomate.io helps you connect cloud apps so you can run a series of actions\\nautomatically in response to an event.\\n\\nFor example, whenever you receive an email in Gmail, you can automatically\\ncreate a new task in Asana or Trello with automate.io. Or, when a customer\\ncompletes a payment in Stripe, you can send them a text message using Twilio.\\n\\nYou can trigger automated workflows based on events (“trigger app”) that happen\\nacross different apps (“connected apps”). Automate.io also lets you perform\\nactions (“actions app”) across other connected apps.\\n\\nIt's called automation because the process happens “automatically” without\\nmanual intervention after the initial configuration is done.\\n\\nZapier [https://zapier.com/] - Free all in one automation tool\\nZapier is an online automation tool that connects your favorite apps, such as\\nShopify, WooCommerce, Mailchimp, Klaviyo, etc. You can connect two or more apps\\nto automate repetitive tasks without coding or relying on developers.\\n\\nThere are millions of ways you can use Zapier. For example, maybe you want every\\nnew customer in Shopify to be automatically added as a subscriber in MailChimp.\\nYou'd create a Zap—or an automated workflow—that watches for new customers in\\nShopify and adds those people to your MailChimp list. Whenever someone places an\\norder in your Shopify store from then on, Zapier will add them to your MailChimp\\nlist automatically.\\n\\nZapier works by watching for triggers in the app where your data starts (for\\nexample, a new sale in Shopify), then it automatically performs actions in the\\napp where you want to use that data (like adding the sale as a new row in\\nExcel).\\n\\nIf you don’t use Shopify, you have nothing to worry about. Zapier works with\\nmost of the biggest eCommerce platforms: WooCommerce, BigCommerce, Wix, and even\\neBay or Amazon.\\n\\nCustomer Relationship Management (CRM) Software\\nCustomer support and satisfaction automation refers to software that helps you\\nautomatically handle customer support issues or customer satisfaction matters.\\n\\nSome tools can help you organize customer data so that when a customer needs\\nhelp or has a complaint, the service team can quickly locate their information\\nwithin your database.\\n\\nOther types of software provide automated responses to customers' questions or\\ncomplaints and can even take on the job of your whole live chat department\\n(these are called Chatbots).\\n\\nHubspot [http://hubspot.com] - The all in one CRM\\nHubSpot is the world's leading inbound marketing and sales platform.
