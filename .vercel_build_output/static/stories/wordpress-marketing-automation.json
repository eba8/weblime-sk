But is that really necessary? If there are plenty of other tools available to help your site with marketing automation, why not just use them?</p><p>In case you hadn't realized it yet: WordPress isn’t very beginner-friendly when it comes to marketing automation unless you are strategic about which plugins you choose to use. There's no built-in way to update your posts or schedule pages for email outreach automatically; for example, you have to do everything yourself manually. And when it comes to lead generation and sales funnels made up of multiple steps, WordPress is hardly the most efficient tool around.</p><p>It's also essential to keep a healthy WordPress installation while working on automation. It's easy to keep adding plugins and features and find yourself with a bloated setup.
