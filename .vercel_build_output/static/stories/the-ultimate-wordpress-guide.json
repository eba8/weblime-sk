The first option is more straightforward, and the latter requires more technical knowledge. </p><p>Either route, WordPress can make your life easier when managing your site and all of its content.</p><p>Arguably, WordPress gained such massive popularity due to the first option; its natural form. In this form, you can put an entire website or app together without touching any code. And even more so, it can be up with the latest trends and requirements; SEO Friendly, Security, Responsiveness, and so much more.</p><h3 id=\"the-problem\">The problem</h3><p>WordPress matured as a platform on a fundamental premise of openness and flexibility. </p><p>Sounds great, right? Yeah, not so fast.</p><p>On the surface, openness and flexibility is an attractive offering. Under the hood, though, it hosts an array of vulnerabilities. </p><p>Essentially, any given WordPress installation will not resemble the next, even when the end goal was the same. This open concept can present not only functional problems but, more importantly, security vulnerabilities.</p><p>If you're just getting started with WordPress, you can quickly find yourself feeling overwhelmed. As of this writing, the official marketplace for WordPress plugins has over 55 thousand options.</p><p>My intention isn't to knock the platform at all. </p><p>I've launched dozens of WordPress websites and developed some opinions about the platform. Learned what I like and what I don't. Each build made the next one more manageable and better. My goal is to share some of the processes and plugins I've found useful.</p><p>I'll treat this guide as the resource I wish I had when starting a digital agency.</p><h3 id=\"the-solution\">The solution</h3><p>My most important rule of thumb to WordPress is not to install more than ten plugins. It has forced me to question my builds continuously. </p><p>The more plugins you install, the more resources that need to be loaded. You want your site to <a href=\"https://www.weblime.com/stories/how-fast-should-a-website-load/\">load blazing fast</a>, be bug-free and secure. So, try to hold back and question yourself before you install yet another plugin.</p><p>How do you limit WordPress to 10 plugins? </p><p>Build, test, and repeat.</p><p>At WebLime, we review WordPress builds for our clients all the time. Something that strikes out the most is WordPress installations having more than 25 plugins. I've even seen sites with more than 50 plugins installed and active!</p><p>Generally, the premium plugins allow you to achieve more. Instead of loading four plugins to achieve four features, you load one plugin that'll cover your needs.</p><p>Also, and you may be surprised to read this in a WordPress guide, but don't swear by WordPress at all costs. </p><p>Sometimes WordPress is not the ultimate solution. </p><p>Since adopting my ten plugin rule, I've had to consider new technologies and approaches for clients. And sometimes, that means walking away from WordPress. </p><p>For example, Shopify is my choice for anything eCommerce.</p><p>I have found that WordPress, a platform that originated from a blogging concept, gets way too bloated when the goal is to build a store. </p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://res-1.cloudinary.com/hsmap5mlr/image/upload/q_auto/v1/ghost-blog-images/WordPress-Plugins.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"The Ultimate WordPress Guide Plugins\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2058\" height=\"1560\"></figure><h3 id=\"recommended-plugins\">Recommended plugins</h3><p>With just about any WordPress build, one of your ongoing considerations is which plugins to install. Essentially, your goal is to choose the best plugins to enhance WordPress and achieve the desired outcome.</p><p>I'll recommend the typical set of plugins we use on just about every WordPress build and then a few extras that I like. </p><p>Before listing anything, I'd like to clarify that we have no affiliation with these plugins. This list is compiled purely from my experience, preference, and opinions.</p><h3 id=\"autoptimize\">Autoptimize</h3><p>My go-to plugin for WordPress optimization is Autoptimize. </p><p>It can aggregate, minify and cache scripts and styles, inject CSS in the page head by default and do so much more. </p><p>Some highlights include:</p><ul><li>Lazy-load images</li><li>Optimize Google Fonts</li><li>Async non-aggregated JS</li></ul><h3 id=\"yoast\">Yoast</h3><p>Once you have a stable build, you'll want to optimize for SEO. My choice here is Yoast. This plugin was founded 14 years ago and has evolved and kept up with WordPress.</p><p>The plugin runs on more than 11 million sites and on 15.4% of the top 1 million sites in the world. That includes our very own White House.</p><p>With Yoast being a part of your build, the ranking will become more intuitive. It'll guide you on SEO basics and best practices. </p><p>Some highlights include:</p><ul><li>Keyword optimization</li><li>Readability check</li><li>No duplicate content</li><li>Works in the block editor, classic editor and Elementor</li><li>Internal linking suggestions</li><li>Redirect manager</li></ul><h3 id=\"elementor\">Elementor</h3><p>Now that your WordPress environment is optimized for speed and search engines, you'll be ready to start building. </p><p>As always, WordPress has a lot of offerings in this respect. I've tried them all and found Elementor to be far superior to the rest. It truly is in a class of its own. </p><p>If you can afford to go for the Pro version, you'll have an even more extensive library of widgets.</p><p>A WordPress builder like I've never experienced before.</p><p>Some highlights include:</p><ul><li>Drag &amp; Drop Editor</li><li>Design system</li><li>Global fonts &amp; colors</li><li>Integrates with many plugins (i.e. Yoast)</li></ul><h3 id=\"woocommerce\">WooCommerce</h3><p>No matter what kind of business you have, WooCommerce is the most customizable eCommerce platform for building your online business. You can sell both physical and digital goods in all shapes and sizes, offer product variations, multiple configurations, instant downloads to customers, and even sell affiliate goods from online marketplaces.</p><p>The WooCommerce Marketplace features over 3,000 extensions that make it easy to customize your store to sell anything you want. Whether you need additional payment gateways, accounting integrations, shipping tools, or marketing extensions - they have it all. Plus, it integrates with industry-leading tools like Google Analytics and MailChimp, so you can keep growing your store with ease.</p><p>WooCommerce is also fully customizable — developers can create their own themes and extend functionality with actions and filters.</p><h3 id=\"advanced-custom-fields\">Advanced Custom Fields</h3><p>ACF is by far one of the most popular WordPress plugins with over 1 million active installs. If you want to customize your edit screens and take full control of your custom fields, this is the perfect plugin for you.</p><p>Advanced Custom Fields (ACF) is a free WordPress plugin that replaces the regular custom fields interface in WordPress with something much more powerful. It helps developers build better content management systems by making it easier to add new fields and display them in the post editor screen.</p><p>The best part about ACF is that it doesn’t require any coding knowledge to use. You can add custom fields for posts and users without writing a single line of code.</p><h2 id=\"sandhills-wp-simple-pay\">Sandhills &amp; WP Simple Pay</h2><p>In general, Sandhills Development has a fantastic WordPress plugins offering. Anything they offer is superior and well crafted.</p><p>If you're not building an eCommerce solution but still have some payment processing requirements, look no further than WP Simple Pay. </p><p>You can accept one-time and recurring payments on your WordPress site without touching any code.</p><p>Some highlights include:</p><ul><li>Drag and drop form builder</li><li>Integrates with Stripe</li><li>Custom subscription options</li><li>Offer discounts and coupon codes</li></ul><h3 id=\"all-in-one-wp-migration\">All-in-One WP Migration</h3><p>If you're building a WordPress instance locally or need to move your website from one server to another, this plugin will be a lifesaver.</p><p>The best part? You can use it then remove it. So, you get the job done, and your site remains clean of excessive plugins.</p><p>In a few clicks, All-in-One will generate a downloadable file of your WordPress website, including the database, media files and plugins.</p><p>Some highlights include:</p><ul><li>Uses chunks to bypass upload size restrictions</li><li>Zero dependencies</li><li>Support for MySQL</li><li>Cloud options</li></ul><h3 id=\"wordpress-tricks\">WordPress tricks</h3><p>One of the faults with <a href=\"https://markodenic.com/wordpress-tips-and-tricks/\">WordPress</a> is that people treat it as a no-code solution. While that's ok, it can lead to WordPress' biggest pitfall: installing an endless amount of plugins. </p><p>My suggestion is to stay away from code for the most part, but be open-minded about touching it when you need to. In some cases, you don't need to understand what's going on entirely; copy and paste a snippet of code into the right location, and it'll work!</p><p>Here's an example of how some of that can look.</p><p>In your child theme, you can add a function to your functions php file. Then add scripts that trigger when the function is called. </p><p>This will allow you to trigger analytics tags like Plausible or Google Search Console, without the need for additional plugins.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-code-card\"><pre><code class=\"language-php\">add_action('wp_head', 'plausible_analytics');\nfunction plausible_analytics() {\n    ?&gt;\n    \n    &lt;script async defer data-domain=\"resourcewranglers.co\" src=\"https://plausible.io/js/plausible.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n\t&lt;meta name=\"google-site-verification\" content=\"-fpnXLanKugbn4DRVsJUkOGHPVCAfmqBfD4Oi7k8ZwE\" /&gt;\n    &lt;?php\n}</code></pre><figcaption>Code sample to inject tags into your header</figcaption></figure><h3 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h3><p>As with anything on the internet, remember that nothing here is the rule of law. </p><p>WordPress, by nature, comes in a raw state, allowing end-users to develop their version of what WordPress can be. </p><p>My encounters and struggles moulded these opinions; they've evolved over the years and are bound for change over time. As this continues to happen, I'll do my best to update this document in hopes that it'll serve others as a reference or starting point when working with WordPress.</p>","comment_id":"60ac0a09e0bb5b049bdb4c3a","feature_image":"https://blog.weblime.com/content/images/2022/02/The-Ultimate-WordPress-Guide.png","featured":false,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"none","created_at":"2021-05-24T16:18:17.000-04:00","updated_at":"2022-04-13T14:10:33.000-04:00","published_at":"2021-05-24T16:20:18.000-04:00","custom_excerpt":"With just about any WordPress build, one of the ongoing considerations is which plugins to install.

The\npower and flexibility of WordPress are simply amazing; no need to sugarcoat that\nfact.\n\nHowever, if you’re looking for a way to extend the power and functionality of\nWordPress, you might consider adding marketing automation tools.\n\nMarketing automation — using marketing tools like email and web analytics to\nautomate tasks across your business -- has been around for ages. But what if you\ncould integrate marketing automation into your existing WordPress site?\n\nDone right, a marketing automation campaign — a.k.a., a sequence of automated\nmarketing tasks planned and executed to achieve specific business outcomes — is\na well-oiled machine that kicks into gear the minute a visitor lands on your\nsite.\n\nWhat is marketing automation, and why is it important?\nMarketing automation is the use of software to automate marketing processes like\nemail and social media. Advanced marketing automation software enables\nbusinesses to streamline, automate, and measure marketing tasks and workflows to\nincrease operational efficiency and grow revenue faster.\n\nMarketing automation includes tools such as email, social media scheduling,\nsurveys, web personalization, and landing pages—tools that today’s consumers\nleverage to witness the rise in popularity of digital channels.\n\nBut why do you need it?\n\nWell, suppose you’re a busy entrepreneur or business owner looking for ways to\nscale your operations but don’t have time for manual data entry. In that case,\nmarketing automation may be perfect for you.\n\nThe tools are easy to learn as well.\n\nFurthermore, many quality platforms offer free trials so you can see how they\nfit your needs before making a purchase decision.\n\nHow using WordPress plugins for marketing automation can make your life easier\nIf you use WordPress for your website and you’ve noticed that marketing\nautomation can be a time-saver, lead generator, and help you stay organized,\nthen using plugins for WordPress marketing automation can definitely work for\nyou.\n\nThere are several benefits to automating your marketing with the help of\nWordPress plugins. You’ll be able to see what works and what doesn’t in order to\nincrease leads. Being able to analyze which content or what products have a\nhigher conversion rate is very valuable information that can reduce your\nworkload.\n\nAutomating your marketing efforts\nIf you want to take your inbound marketing to the next level, then adding\nHubSpot's WordPress plugin for tracking is a must. If you're one of the many\nWordPress users out there who has a website made with WordPress and a HubSpot\naccount, you can use this handy plugin to help you add more data about your\nvisitors and follow up with them via email.\n\nHubSpot provides a plugin that allows you to integrate your HubSpot account with\nyour WordPress site, so customers can enter their details directly into your\nwebsite form, entering them into the lead nurturing and tracking funnel.\n\nThis is what HubSpot can help you with:\n\n * Easily add forms to your website: The HubSpot Marketing Plugin makes it\n   simple to create, customize, and embed your own forms on posts and pages.\n   Their drag-and-drop form builder allows you to tailor forms for any marketing\n   need.\n * Personalize the visitor experience: You can personalize every visitor's\n   experience by using information from their contact records. Create smart\n   lists based on specific criteria like contact attributes or behaviors, and\n   use those lists in a content personalization tool to create unique\n   experiences for contacts as they visit your site or blog.\n * Learn more about how people interact with your site: The plugin’s analytics\n   feature gives you access to page-level performance data within WordPress, so\n   you don't have to leave the platform. Analyze trends across pages and posts,\n   see which pages are most engaging, view referral traffic sources, and see\n   which content generates the most leads within WordPress.\n\nUsing the Site Kit plugin for WordPress\nFinally, a way to get the most out of your WordPress site without having to dig\nthrough data and charts or spend hours poring over spreadsheets.\n\nSite Kit is an official plugin from Google that lets you access data from\nmultiple sources (such as Google Analytics or Google Ads) directly from your\nWordPress dashboard.\n\nWith this plugin, you'll be able to:\n\n * View your stats directly on your WordPress dashboard and make decisions based\n   on that data;\n * View stats from multiple Google tools such as Google Analytics or Google\n   Search Console;\n * Set up various Google tools without touching a single line of code;\n * Track your desired KPIs for the entire website or specific pages only.\n\nSite Kit supports the following tools:\n\n 1. Google Analytics. You will be able to track the goals you set up for your\n    users;\n 2. Google Search Console. You will get access to Google search data and\n    understand how Google displays your pages on the search engine. With this\n    feature, you can also find out what keywords visitors used to land on your\n    website;\n 3. Google Tag Manager. Most business owners are reticent when it comes to\n    installing tools and editing code on their websites. With this tool, you can\n    now easily set up Google Tag Manager without having to change any line of\n    code;\n 4. Page Speed Insights. The tool will tell you what's holding your page back\n    from loading faster, including recommendations for improving performance\n    (like optimizing images or caching resources). You can even see how other\n    sites have solved similar problems so that you don't have to reinvent the\n    wheel every time!\n 5. Google Optimize. Once you've got Site Kit installed on your site, you'll be\n    able to set up Optimize and create tests in just a few minutes.\n\nUpon installing Site Kit, you just need to give it the necessary permissions and\nverify your site ownership.\n\nUsing WooCommerce for your ecommerce site\nWooCommerce is a free ecommerce plugin for WordPress, used by over 3 million\nactive websites. In addition to being one of the most popular options for online\nsellers, WooCommerce has many unique benefits.\n\nAmong these are its flexibility and customizability—it’s easy to integrate into\nyour website and can be modified with a wide variety of extensions and themes.\n\nIn addition to its functionality, WooCommerce is also extremely easy to use—both\nfor the store owner and their customers. The interface is designed in such a way\nthat beginners can use it but still offers powerful features for advanced users.\n\nBest of all, once you’ve set up your WordPress marketing automation system using\nAutomateWoo, you can use it as a guide to setting up your WooCommerce\nintegration with WordPress for ecommerce!\n\nLearn more about eCommerece marketing: eCommerce Marketing Automation - Tools &\nBest Practices [https://www.weblime.com/stories/ecommerce-marketing-automation/]\n.\n\nActiveCampaign Plugin for WordPress\nThe ActiveCampaign Plugin for WordPress allows you to pull your contact's\ninformation into WordPress and display it in a single location.

In this scenario, you might send them a welcome message\nimmediately but then wait two days before sending another email with a\nhyper-specific sales pitch.\n\nThere are lots of ways you can use drip emails in your business. You could use\nthem to remind customers that their credit card is about to expire or to notify\nthem that their domain name will expire soon. You could even use drip emails to\nnurture leads until they’re ready to buy.\n\nDrip Email comes with all those features in the free version and is constantly\nupdating its platform to make it even better. They also have some great other\nintegrations, like conversion tracking, full Google Analytics integration, and\nmore.\n\nGravity Forms Plugin for WordPress\nGravity Forms is the plugin you should use to create your forms, and while it\nisn't free (you can purchase a single-site license for $59 per year), Gravity\nForms is one of the most popular form builders, with good reason. It's\nincredibly flexible, highly extendable, and very easy to use.\n\nWhether you're creating a complex application form or just trying to collect\nleads from your WordPress website, Gravity Forms gives you the ability to create\ncustom forms that perfectly match your needs.\n\nYou can quickly drag & drop form fields into place while being able to visualize\na form workflow with Preview. This can help enhance your website experience and\nmake a much nicer user experience when you have longer forms.\n\nAutomating social sharing\nThe Easy Social Sharing plugin for WordPress is a highly rated and loved plugin.\nIt helps you integrate more than 20 social sharing buttons on your WordPress\nwebsite.\n\nFurthermore, the plugin allows you to add social share buttons to your posts and\npages, which means that it can be used for:\n\n * Adding buttons like Facebook Like, Facebook Share, Tweet This, and Google +1\n   to your blog posts;\n * Adding floating share bars that stay visible as the reader scrolls down;\n * Adding share buttons to images in your posts.\n\nWe all know that creating content is often not enough. You should also plan to\ndistribute it to the right social media platforms. With the help of this plugin,\nyou can automatically do just that without the hassle of having to switch tabs.\nBonus points, your visitors will also be able to share a blog post on their\nsocial media easily.\n\nTo set up the plugin, you need to configure it from the settings tab:\n\nYou can choose the specific location where you want the social sharing buttons\nto be displayed and allow these buttons to be displayed on mobile devices.\n\nUnder the “Network” tab, you can choose which social media channels you want to\nbe displayed:\n\nIn terms of designing the layout, you can choose which colors to use to line up\nwith your branding.\n\nAutomate SEO tasks with Yoast SEO\nSo, what can you do to make your WordPress content more SEO-friendly? You can\nuse the Yoast SEO plugin for WordPress. The first thing it does is help you\noptimize your content for Google and other search engines. And that’s not all!\nIt also enables you to optimize your content for readability.\n\nWhen it comes to keyword optimization, Yoast offers a built-in keyword analysis\ntool that scans your page or post title and content and suggests changes to\nimprove your SEO score for a chosen keyword.\n\nIn terms of automating SEO, you can choose to change your settings in bulk. For\nexample, you can change meta titles and descriptions without having to edit each\npage one by one.\n\nSimply go to the Tools section and click on “Bulk Editor.” You’ll have access to\na dashboard that includes all your pages, and you can simply change the titles\nand descriptions one by one.\n\nMarketing automation tools don't have to be complicated!\nWe could fork over a large sum of our hard-earned cash in the name of\nconvenience and future proofing. But is that really necessary? If there are\nplenty of other tools available to help your site with marketing automation, why\nnot just use them?\n\nIn case you hadn't realized it yet: WordPress isn’t very beginner-friendly when\nit comes to marketing automation unless you are strategic about which plugins\nyou choose to use. There's no built-in way to update your posts or schedule\npages for email outreach automatically; for example, you have to do everything\nyourself manually. And when it comes to lead generation and sales funnels made\nup of multiple steps, WordPress is hardly the most efficient tool around.\n\nIt's also essential to keep a healthy WordPress installation while working on\nautomation. It's easy to keep adding plugins and features and find yourself with\na bloated setup.

It can be a scary step, but it will feel more\nlike a comfortable step into the future if you have the right tools, like the\nright blogging platform.\n\nYou might not know how important it is to choose the right blogging platform for\nyour photography business. The truth is—when you publish photos on different\nplatforms like Instagram or Facebook, only a tiny percentage of viewers actually\nsee them. And when viewers do see them, they’re often fed more, so it’s hard for\nthem to keep up with everything you’ve done, which leaves them feeling\ndisconnected from your work.\n\nA blog is different from these other platforms because it is all about building\nan online presence on your website. Your blog\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog] will be constantly updated with new content\nto help your audience connect with what you have to share. The most successful\nbloggers post anywhere from 2-5 times a week and repost their previous posts to\nkeep their content fresh and easily accessible. No matter how many times you\nrepost, if you choose the right platform for bloggers, people will always be\nable to find new content to maintain a connection and feel like they’re part of\nsomething.\n\nBenefits of a photography blog\nThe benefits of creating a blog for your photography business are infinite. We\ncan think of a few things as exciting as having a blog to share your photos,\nexpress yourself, and let the world know what you do.\n\nBlogging is often one of the biggest factors in the success of photographers.\nHere are just a few of the many reasons why you should start blogging:\n\n * Showcase your work and build an online portfolio. One of the best ways to get\n   noticed is to have your work seen by as many people as possible—and with a\n   blog, you can easily do that.\n * Build your brand and gain exposure. Blogging is a great way to increase\n   traffic to your website, grow your social media following, and improve SEO\n   for your website or business.\n * Connect with like-minded people and build a community. Building relationships\n   within the photography community is one of the best ways to stay inspired,\n   grow as an artist, improve your photography skills and knowledge, find\n   clients, and generally enjoy being part of a supportive network where you can\n   share ideas.\n * Share your knowledge and expertise. As well as helping you connect with other\n   photographers, you can use blogging as a platform for sharing what you know\n   about photography with others—and when they see how much value they're\n   getting from reading what you write, they'll be more likely to want to come\n   back for more!\n\nBest blogging platforms for photographers\nWordPress is the most popular blogging platform for photographers. It offers a\nhigh degree of flexibility, including the ability to customize your site's\ndesign, add plugins, and integrate an online store. Tumblr isn't a traditional\nblogging platform, but it's another good option for photography blogs. The\nservice lets you create a photography blog easily, sharing just one shot or\nseveral in each post.\n\nGhost is another platform that promises photographers \"the best publishing tools\non the planet,\" according to its website. Ghost has a sleek interface and makes\nit easy to share links, videos, and photos in posts. You can even choose from\nmore than 100 themes to match your photography blog's style and personality.\n\nOn the other hand, Wix is one of the most accessible options for building a\nphotography blog without coding skills. Squarespace is another user-friendly\nsite builder that offers plenty of templates explicitly designed with\nphotographers in mind (including special features like slideshows).\n\nWordPress\nWordPress is the oldest and most widely used blogging platform. It boasts a huge\ndeveloper community that has created over 50,000 plugins and thousands of\nthemes. Because WordPress is open-source, you don’t have to pay for the platform\nitself or most plugins and themes. There are two versions of WordPress:\n\n * WordPress.com—This version of WordPress gives you access to hundreds of free\n   themes and thousands of free plugins. In its free starter plan, you also get\n   unlimited storage space, which is ideal for photographers with large files\n   that take up more storage space than text-heavy sites. However, it doesn’t\n   offer a free custom domain name; instead, it provides a subdomain\n   (yourblog.wordpress.com).\n * WordPress.org—WordPress's self-hosted version allows you to host your blog on\n   your server so you can customize anything without worrying about someone\n   shutting down your blog.\n\nCheck out our WordPress guide\n[https://www.weblime.com/stories/the-ultimate-wordpress-guide] if you decide to\ngo in this route.\n\nGhost\nGhost is a blogging platform that has taken the world by storm. It's been\npraised for its easy-to-use interface and customization options, allowing users\nto create their ideal website.\n\nGhost’s team also created a simple editor to write your stories and blog posts\neasily, as well as an author section where you can introduce yourself to\nvisitors with your author bio.\n\nGhost has built-in SEO options and code injection capabilities, so it's always\ngood to go for search engine ranking or quick compatibility fixes. You’ll also\nbe able to publish your content directly on Facebook, Twitter, or other social\nmedia channels from Ghost’s dashboard.\n\nGhost is an excellent option for photographers if you're looking for an\neasy-to-use blogging platform focused on writing!\n\nWix\nThe truth is, Wix is a powerful tool that allows you to build truly beautiful\nwebsites. The platform has many unique features, including templates perfect for\nphotographers. You can create photo galleries with albums and photos easily\ncustomizable via drag and drop. You also have access to great editing tools,\nlike lightbox and automatic image optimization. This makes creating high-quality\nsites a snap.\n\nSquarespace\nSquarespace is a popular and easy-to-use website builder that offers several\ntemplates for photographers. If you’re not experienced with coding and want to\nput together a portfolio quickly, Squarespace is a great choice. The platform is\nextremely user-friendly, making it easy to add your images and set up your site\nin just hours. You can also take advantage of the support community or search\nthrough the help forums if you need extra assistance creating your photography\nwebsite.\n\nLimey\nWhen photographers do business with clients, they often have to send the client\na portfolio, which is only accessible via the photographer's website. Moreover,\nthe photographer’s portfolio could live on different platforms, making it hard\nto decide which link to send to a potential client.\n\nThe problem with this solution is that there is no way for clients to easily get\na sense of what kind of work the photographer does and how they could\npotentially help them.\n\nThat's why we created Limey [https://limey.io/]. Limey is a landing page builder\nthat helps photographers easily create digital business cards for their relevant\nportfolios (e.g., Shutterstock, Behance). Limey allows photographers to add\nlinks to their existing online portfolios and populate their landing pages with\nlinks to any websites they want to refer clients to. Clients will be able to\nvisit these pages and immediately get an idea of what kind of services or\nproducts a specific photographer offers.\n\nPick the right blogging platform to save time, energy, and effort so that you\ncan focus on what's important.\nOne of the most important decisions you’ll make as a blogger is choosing a\nblogging platform. The right blogging platform for your needs can help you save\ntime, energy, and effort to focus on what’s important – putting your best foot\nforward.\n\nThe following are some of the criteria we recommend thinking about when choosing\nyour photography blog platform:\n\n * Ease of use – an easy to use interface will save you time and money. You\n   won’t have to spend hours learning how to use it or fork over big bucks for\n   someone else to do it for you. Some popular platforms may seem easy at first\n   glance, but they can become complicated if customization is needed once you\n   dig deeper.\n * Features – Is there room to grow? Can the platform evolve with your changing\n   needs? Does it allow plugins or themes that will help expand its\n   capabilities? Will it provide everything you need now and in the future?\n * Branding – Does the platform allow complete control over your content and\n   branding? If branding matters to you, then choose carefully. Some platforms\n   add watermarks and links back to themselves and control what content goes on\n   your site. Avoid these unless this is acceptable to you.\n\nYou now have a pretty good idea of what you should be looking for in a\nphotography blog platform.\n\nThe most important thing to remember is that the perfect platform doesn't exist.\nYou need to pick one that will allow you to focus on what's really important:\nyour photography.","excerpt":"We reviewed the top photography blog platforms on the market.

Marketing automation apps for Woocommerce \n 6.  How effective is eCommerce marketing automation? \n\nAs your eCommerce business grows, so do your marketing needs. Marketing\nautomation tools are supposed to help you prioritize and handle the many\ndifferent pieces of your online campaigns. eCommerce companies are growing in\nnumber at an astonishing rate, and separating yourself from your competitors\nrequires a well-planned out strategy.\n\nAttracting new users and converting them into paying customers is a top priority\nfor every eCommerce business. But once you’ve given them your product, how can\nyou make sure they come back?\n\nYou’ll need to analyze your website's metrics, keep track of visitors,\ncommunicate with potential customers, and the list goes on.\n\nThis article will cover the principles of eCommerce marketing automation and how\nit can make your life easier while your business grows to new levels.\n\nWhat is eCommerce marketing automation?\nEcommerce marketing automation refers to software built to automate repetitive\nmarketing tasks. This includes following up with leads, sending e-mails, and\ncollecting information.\n\nAutomating your eCommerce marketing can help you free up time by creating and\nlaunching campaigns. The days when you had to hire people for mundane tasks are\nlong gone. Developers and companies have created software that will remove the\nblood, sweat, and tears from repetitive tasks so you can focus on other aspects\nof your business.\n\nWhat does eCommerce marketing automation include?\nAutomation takes care of marketing and sales engagement while driving \nmeasurable\nresults [https://www.weblime.com/stories/ecommerce-dashboard]. It allows you to\neasily design, execute, and automate your campaigns or tasks across multiple\ndepartments. You can simultaneously scale up your marketing efforts while\nachieving a consistent customer experience.\n\nAutomation software comes in many different forms. Some simplify workflows,\nwhile others tackle analysis. Let's take a closer look at four of the most\nvaluable types of automation software.\n\nMarketing Automation Software\n\nMarketing automation software is all about simplifying and streamlining your\nmarketing processes. For example, you can use it to automate repetitive tasks\nlike email campaigns. Marketing automation tools\n[https://www.weblime.com/stories/shopify-automation] also help track and analyze\nmarketing and sales data to easily get a big picture view of all your marketing\nendeavors.\n\nWorkflow automation\n\nHigh-volume retailers often use workflow automation tools to ensure their orders\nare processed efficiently. Workflow automation software can automatically update\nsystems when orders are shipped or returned, track inventory, and make sure\ncustomers are billed correctly. Some workflow automation tools can also make\nrecommendations based on past performance and projected demand.\n\nCustomer Relationship Management (CRM) Software\n\nCRM software deals with customer interactions on an individual level. This is\nwhere you'll find information about customers' details, contact information, and\norder histories. It also allows you to send personalized emails, messages, and\npromotions to specific customers based on their actions or data. Because of\nthis, CRM helps improve customer relations significantly by assisting companies\nin sending the right message to the right person at the right time.\n\nWeb Analytics Software\n\nWeb Analytics is where you find data about how visitors interact with your\nwebsite or online store. Tracking metrics like bounce rate, page views per\nvisit, and time on site are essential for understanding which pages are working\nbest and which ones need improvement. With data from web analytics software, you\ncan calculate how well your campaigns are performing and how good your website’s\nUI/UX is.\n\nBest eCommerce Automation Tools\nNow that you know the main categories of eCommerce marketing automation its time\nto have a closer look at some of the best tools out there.\n\nEmail Marketing Automation Tools\n\nTo recap, email marketing automation is a way to deliver emails to customers\nbased on their behaviors. You can also segment users based on demographics, such\nas age, location, or behavior.\n\nSome examples of email marketing automation include:\n\nAbandoned Cart Emails\n\nMany users tend to add a product to their carts and never really finish the\ncheckout process. They might want to save their cart for later, but they simply\nforget about it in most cases.\n\nInstead of losing these customers, you can set up an abandoned cart email\ncampaign that will automatically send out a message reminding users about the\nproducts they never really purchased. This can help you increase sales for an\nextremely low cost, and it’s all automatic.\n\nCross-sell and Upsell Emails\n\nAfter users purchase a product from your store, they will most likely receive a\nconfirmation email. This is usually autogenerated by the eCommerce platform you\nare using. But after they get this initial email, most people never hear back\nfrom the store they just purchased from.\n\nA cross-sell or upsell email campaign automatically sends out a message to your\nprevious customers so they can come back and buy again. When you set up such a\ncampaign, you want to make sure that you also include an incentive (like a\ndiscount coupon) so people will be more likely to reorder from your store.\n\nRemember, previous customers are more likely to purchase from you than new\nusers. This happens because they already trust your business and know that there\nis nothing to worry about.\n\nCustomer Engagement Emails\n\nIf your store allows users to create an account, you should have a bunch of\nuseful information about them. Customer engagement emails are a great way to\nstrengthen the relationship between your business and users by sending them a\n“Happy Birthday” message with a special discount.\n\nBuilding this relationship will turn customers into brand advocates who will\nrecommend your store to their friends and family.\n\nPromotional Emails\n\nSay you have ordered a large quantity of a specific product because your\nsupplier had a great offer. You now decide to run a campaign and apply a\ndiscount to that particular product or category.\n\nThe best and cheapest way to boost your sales is to set up a promotional email\ncampaign and let everyone on your list know about your offer.\n\nOn the other hand, if your stock runs low on a product and you want to get rid\nof it to buy its new variant, you can send out a message to your list letting\nthem know about it.\n\nKlaviyo [https://www.klaviyo.com/] - most accessible email marketing automation\ntool\nKlaviyo helps e‑commerce businesses collect, analyze and use customer data to\noptimize marketing strategies and maximize revenue. The platform allows\ncompanies to send personalized email marketing campaigns to customers.\n\nThe best thing about Klaviyo is that it comes with predefined automation\ntemplates that work out of the box. Let’s have a look at how you can set up your\nfirst Welcome Series flow.\n\nOnce you sign in to Klaviyo, you will see the following screen:\n\nNext, you’ll have to click on the Flows menu item on the left side of the page.\nFlows are automations that will do the heavy lifting of email marketing for you.\n\nKlaviyo lets you create separate Lists based on multiple criteria.\n\nFor example, you can create a list of:\n\n * People that have ordered a specific product;\n * New users that have signed up to your newsletter;\n * Existing customers that have purchased from you more than two times.\n\nThe possibilities are endless here, but for this example, I am going to consider\nyou simply having the default “New Subscribers” list.\n\nYou will have to click on the “Get Started” button right below the “Welcome\nEmail” card on the Flows screen.\n\nOnce you do that, you’ll see this screen:\n\nGo ahead and select your list, then click on continue.\n\nThe Flow editor will open up, and it looks like this:\n\nBy default, Klaviyo has already added three steps to this Flow:\n\n 1. When a new email gets added to your database, it will instantly receive a\n    Welcome Message.\n 2. After three days from the previous email, that address will receive an\n    additional message.\n 3. After four days from the previous email, that address will receive the last\n    message in this sequence.\n\nNow you want to write and design these emails. You’ll have to click on the first\nemail box, then click edit on the panel on the left.\n\nNow you’ll see a screen that allows you to edit the sender’s name and email\naddress, subject line, and preview text. Once you complete these fields, you can\nclick on the “Edit Content” button to take you to the email content editor page.\n\nAfter creating the first email, you can click on the “Save Content” button. This\nwill take you back to the previous page and save all your progress.\n\nClick “Done” in the top right corner, and you’ll be taken back to the initial\nFlow page.\n\nThe last step you have to take is to set your first email as “Live.” To do so,\nclick on the “Draft” text on the bottom left of the email card and select\n“Live.”\n\nCongratulations! You just configured your first email that will be sent\nautomatically by Klaviyo when a new email address gets added to your list.\n\nNow you have to follow the same steps to finish the other two emails. Once you\nare done, you can click on the “Save & Exit” button in the top right corner:\n\nTo make sure your Flow works, look for a small green dot besides its name in the\nFlows screen:\n\nNow that you have your first Flow, it's time to configure more! After all, you\nwant to automate every aspect of your email marketing efforts completely.\n\nClick on the blue “Create Flow” button in the top right corner of the screen.\n\nAs I previously mentioned, Klaviyo provides a vast template library you can pick\nFlows from.\n\nKlaviyo is a truly comprehensive email marketing tool that can even automate SMS\ncampaigns. Because it has so many features, you might feel lost at first, but\nwith time and a few tutorials, you’ll get the hang of it in no time.\n\nAnother email marketing tool you can use is Mailchimp. The great thing about it\nis that it also acts like a CRM (Customer Relationship Management) platform.\n\nMailchimp [https://mailchimp.com/] - an all in one sales automation tool\nMailchimp is an easy-to-use marketing automation platform for SMBs. You can\ncreate and send email newsletters, manage your subscriber lists, and track\ncampaign performance.\n\nWith Mailchimp, you can automate tasks like welcoming new subscribers,\nre-engaging inactive customers, and following up with people after they buy\nsomething. The platform makes it easy to connect with your audience across\nvarious channels—email, web, mobile, and more—so you can market smarter and grow\nfaster.\n\nMailChimp has many tools to help your business grow, so you can stay organized,\nreach customers wherever they are, sell more stuff, and boost your bottom line.\n\nCreate Signup Forms\n\nGet new subscribers from anywhere on the web, with forms that match the look and\nfeel of your brand.\n\nAnalyze Your Audience Segments\n\nSee which groups of subscribers are opening and clicking on emails, so you can\nfigure out who to send more stuff to.\n\nSend the Right Messages to the Right People\n\nQuickly target segments like first-time buyers or people who abandoned their\ncarts to make sure you're constantly sending relevant messages.\n\nCompared to Klaviyo, Mailchimp might feel a bit more complicated for first-time\nusers.\n\nNow that you know how to automate your email campaigns is time to look at how\nyou can integrate this part of your marketing strategy with your store’s\ninventory. This will not only help your cash flow, but it will open up new\npossibilities you haven’t even thought of.\n\nWorkflow automation\n\nWorkflow automation software is designed to streamline manual processes. For\nexample, your inventory management system needs to interact with both systems if\nyou sell products through your eCommerce website and your brick-and-mortar\nstore.\n\nWorkflow automation software can ensure that inventory quantities in both\nsystems are always correct by performing updates in real-time.\n\nAutomate.io [http://automate.io] - Connect your cloud apps\nAautomate.io helps you connect cloud apps so you can run a series of actions\nautomatically in response to an event.\n\nFor example, whenever you receive an email in Gmail, you can automatically\ncreate a new task in Asana or Trello with automate.io. Or, when a customer\ncompletes a payment in Stripe, you can send them a text message using Twilio.\n\nYou can trigger automated workflows based on events (“trigger app”) that happen\nacross different apps (“connected apps”). Automate.io also lets you perform\nactions (“actions app”) across other connected apps.\n\nIt's called automation because the process happens “automatically” without\nmanual intervention after the initial configuration is done.\n\nZapier [https://zapier.com/] - Free all in one automation tool\nZapier is an online automation tool that connects your favorite apps, such as\nShopify, WooCommerce, Mailchimp, Klaviyo, etc. You can connect two or more apps\nto automate repetitive tasks without coding or relying on developers.\n\nThere are millions of ways you can use Zapier. For example, maybe you want every\nnew customer in Shopify to be automatically added as a subscriber in MailChimp.\nYou'd create a Zap—or an automated workflow—that watches for new customers in\nShopify and adds those people to your MailChimp list. Whenever someone places an\norder in your Shopify store from then on, Zapier will add them to your MailChimp\nlist automatically.\n\nZapier works by watching for triggers in the app where your data starts (for\nexample, a new sale in Shopify), then it automatically performs actions in the\napp where you want to use that data (like adding the sale as a new row in\nExcel).\n\nIf you don’t use Shopify, you have nothing to worry about. Zapier works with\nmost of the biggest eCommerce platforms: WooCommerce, BigCommerce, Wix, and even\neBay or Amazon.\n\nCustomer Relationship Management (CRM) Software\nCustomer support and satisfaction automation refers to software that helps you\nautomatically handle customer support issues or customer satisfaction matters.\n\nSome tools can help you organize customer data so that when a customer needs\nhelp or has a complaint, the service team can quickly locate their information\nwithin your database.\n\nOther types of software provide automated responses to customers' questions or\ncomplaints and can even take on the job of your whole live chat department\n(these are called Chatbots).\n\nHubspot [http://hubspot.com] - The all in one CRM\nHubSpot is the world's leading inbound marketing and sales platform. Over 8,000\ncustomers in more than 90 countries use HubSpot's software, services, and\nsupport to transform how they attract, engage, and delight customers.\n\nA powerful, easy-to-use marketing automation platform that helps small and\nmedium companies get more traffic and leads.\n\nHubSpot Sales includes tools and templates for email outreach and follow-up,\nmeeting scheduling, lead intelligence, and more.\n\nHubSpot Service Hub is a customer service software that helps you deliver a\ndelightful experience at every turn - from your website to your help desk.\n\nThis massive platform has a steep learning curve, so I wouldn’t recommend it if\nyou are just starting. However, the sky is the limit once your systems are in\nplace.\n\nChatfuel [https://chatfuel.com/] - Easiest way to create a chatbot\nChatfuel helps business owners and marketers build Facebook Messenger chatbots\nwithout coding. The Chatfuel platform makes it easy for anyone to engage their\ncustomers and grow their brand from small businesses to large enterprises.\n\nYou can use a chatbot to instantly engage with your website visitors and boost\nyour conversion rate. It doesn’t matter if you have a dedicated live chat team.\nWith the help of a bot, you can reduce the response time to a few seconds and\nconvert more visitors into customers.\n\nSay you run Facebook ads and get a ton of questions regarding your products. You\nhave to spend quite some time answering all of them, plus most people ask you\nthe same thing repeatedly.\n\nWith the help of a bot, you can instantly answer all questions.\n\nWeb Analytics\nEcommerce businesses have access to more data than ever before. Still, they\ndon’t always have the resources or knowledge to turn that data into actionable\ninsights—this is why a web analytics tool is a vital asset for your eCommerce\nmarketing automation stack.\n\nGoogle Analytics [https://analytics.google.com/]\nGoogle Analytics is a free tool designed to help you analyze your marketing\ndata. It collects information about your eCommerce site's visitors and compiles\nreports about the number of visitors, their behaviors, and the effectiveness of\nyour marketing efforts.\n\nYou can use these reports to evaluate your content and make informed decisions\non how to improve your marketing strategies.\n\nHeap [https://heap.io/] - An eCommerce centric analytics platform\nHeap is a customer analytics platform that automatically captures every user\naction on your website and lets you measure it all.\n\nHeap's customer analytics platform tracks every touch, click, tap, swipe, and\ntransaction across your website.

Unfortunately, this app only works with\nShopify Plus stores, but it might make sense to upgrade just to get access to\nFlow (as the app is free).\n\nThere are hundreds of possible marketing automations you can set up using Flow:\n\n * Add a gift to orders over $100;\n * Text a discount code after a 2nd order;\n * Mail handwritten note after a 3rd order;\n * Kick-off nurture campaigns for preorder purchases;\n * Create a support ticket when you receive a negative review and many more;\n\nFlow is a free app, so all you have to do is install it and start configuring\nyour marketing automations in no time.\n\nSince WooCommerce is still the biggest eCommerce CMS out there, it’s only\nnatural that I cover the best marketing automation plugins you can install right\nnow from the WordPress plugin repository.\n\nMarketing automation apps for Woocommerce\nWooCommerce [https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce/] is a free eCommerce\nplugin that allows you to sell anything beautifully.
