Amazon is known for its excellent customer\n   service, so you can rest assured that your buyers will be taken care of if\n   they have any questions or problems, without any extra involvment from you.\n\nCons of selling on Amazon\n * You'll need to pay fees. Unlike Shopify, which has a monthly subscription\n   fee, Amazon charges sellers a per-sale fee as well as a monthly subscription\n   fee.\n * You may need to invest in additional tools. While Amazon does provide some\n   tools for sellers, you may need to invest in additional software to help you\n   manage your inventory and shipping.\n * There's a lot of competition. Because Amazon is such a popular platform,\n   there's a lot of competition among sellers. This means that you'll need to\n   work hard to make your listings stand out.\n * Lack of control over storytelling and branding. On Amazon, your product\n   listings will look very similar to everyone else's. For the most part, you're\n   using pre-built formatting and design, so it can be difficult to tell your\n   brand's story and build a strong connection with customers.\n\nThe verdict: Shopify or Amazon?\nSo, which eCommerce platform is right for you? As you can see, it really depends\non your needs and preferences. If you're looking for a trustworthy marketplace\nto sell your goods with a more \"hands-off\" approach, Amazon is a good option.\nHowever, if you want more control (CEO vibes) over your branding and\nstorytelling, Shopify may be a better fit.\n\nNo matter which platform you choose, the most important thing is to start\nbuilding your eCommerce business today. While it can be difficult navigating\neither platform, it doesn't have to be with Weblime's in-house designers and\ncopywriters who are at-the-ready to deliver your message attractively and\ncompellingly.\n\nNeed help building your eCommerce store?

Marketing automation apps for Woocommerce \n 6.  How effective is eCommerce marketing automation? \n\nAs your eCommerce business grows, so do your marketing needs. Marketing\nautomation tools are supposed to help you prioritize and handle the many\ndifferent pieces of your online campaigns. eCommerce companies are growing in\nnumber at an astonishing rate, and separating yourself from your competitors\nrequires a well-planned out strategy.\n\nAttracting new users and converting them into paying customers is a top priority\nfor every eCommerce business. But once you’ve given them your product, how can\nyou make sure they come back?\n\nYou’ll need to analyze your website's metrics, keep track of visitors,\ncommunicate with potential customers, and the list goes on.\n\nThis article will cover the principles of eCommerce marketing automation and how\nit can make your life easier while your business grows to new levels.\n\nWhat is eCommerce marketing automation?\nEcommerce marketing automation refers to software built to automate repetitive\nmarketing tasks. This includes following up with leads, sending e-mails, and\ncollecting information.\n\nAutomating your eCommerce marketing can help you free up time by creating and\nlaunching campaigns. The days when you had to hire people for mundane tasks are\nlong gone. Developers and companies have created software that will remove the\nblood, sweat, and tears from repetitive tasks so you can focus on other aspects\nof your business.\n\nWhat does eCommerce marketing automation include?\nAutomation takes care of marketing and sales engagement while driving \nmeasurable\nresults [https://www.weblime.com/stories/ecommerce-dashboard]. It allows you to\neasily design, execute, and automate your campaigns or tasks across multiple\ndepartments. You can simultaneously scale up your marketing efforts while\nachieving a consistent customer experience.\n\nAutomation software comes in many different forms. Some simplify workflows,\nwhile others tackle analysis. Let's take a closer look at four of the most\nvaluable types of automation software.\n\nMarketing Automation Software\n\nMarketing automation software is all about simplifying and streamlining your\nmarketing processes. For example, you can use it to automate repetitive tasks\nlike email campaigns. Marketing automation tools\n[https://www.weblime.com/stories/shopify-automation] also help track and analyze\nmarketing and sales data to easily get a big picture view of all your marketing\nendeavors.\n\nWorkflow automation\n\nHigh-volume retailers often use workflow automation tools to ensure their orders\nare processed efficiently. Workflow automation software can automatically update\nsystems when orders are shipped or returned, track inventory, and make sure\ncustomers are billed correctly. Some workflow automation tools can also make\nrecommendations based on past performance and projected demand.\n\nCustomer Relationship Management (CRM) Software\n\nCRM software deals with customer interactions on an individual level. This is\nwhere you'll find information about customers' details, contact information, and\norder histories. It also allows you to send personalized emails, messages, and\npromotions to specific customers based on their actions or data. Because of\nthis, CRM helps improve customer relations significantly by assisting companies\nin sending the right message to the right person at the right time.\n\nWeb Analytics Software\n\nWeb Analytics is where you find data about how visitors interact with your\nwebsite or online store. Tracking metrics like bounce rate, page views per\nvisit, and time on site are essential for understanding which pages are working\nbest and which ones need improvement. With data from web analytics software, you\ncan calculate how well your campaigns are performing and how good your website’s\nUI/UX is.\n\nBest eCommerce Automation Tools\nNow that you know the main categories of eCommerce marketing automation its time\nto have a closer look at some of the best tools out there.\n\nEmail Marketing Automation Tools\n\nTo recap, email marketing automation is a way to deliver emails to customers\nbased on their behaviors. You can also segment users based on demographics, such\nas age, location, or behavior.\n\nSome examples of email marketing automation include:\n\nAbandoned Cart Emails\n\nMany users tend to add a product to their carts and never really finish the\ncheckout process. They might want to save their cart for later, but they simply\nforget about it in most cases.\n\nInstead of losing these customers, you can set up an abandoned cart email\ncampaign that will automatically send out a message reminding users about the\nproducts they never really purchased. This can help you increase sales for an\nextremely low cost, and it’s all automatic.\n\nCross-sell and Upsell Emails\n\nAfter users purchase a product from your store, they will most likely receive a\nconfirmation email. This is usually autogenerated by the eCommerce platform you\nare using. But after they get this initial email, most people never hear back\nfrom the store they just purchased from.\n\nA cross-sell or upsell email campaign automatically sends out a message to your\nprevious customers so they can come back and buy again. When you set up such a\ncampaign, you want to make sure that you also include an incentive (like a\ndiscount coupon) so people will be more likely to reorder from your store.\n\nRemember, previous customers are more likely to purchase from you than new\nusers. This happens because they already trust your business and know that there\nis nothing to worry about.\n\nCustomer Engagement Emails\n\nIf your store allows users to create an account, you should have a bunch of\nuseful information about them. Customer engagement emails are a great way to\nstrengthen the relationship between your business and users by sending them a\n“Happy Birthday” message with a special discount.\n\nBuilding this relationship will turn customers into brand advocates who will\nrecommend your store to their friends and family.\n\nPromotional Emails\n\nSay you have ordered a large quantity of a specific product because your\nsupplier had a great offer. You now decide to run a campaign and apply a\ndiscount to that particular product or category.\n\nThe best and cheapest way to boost your sales is to set up a promotional email\ncampaign and let everyone on your list know about your offer.\n\nOn the other hand, if your stock runs low on a product and you want to get rid\nof it to buy its new variant, you can send out a message to your list letting\nthem know about it.\n\nKlaviyo [https://www.klaviyo.com/] - most accessible email marketing automation\ntool\nKlaviyo helps e‑commerce businesses collect, analyze and use customer data to\noptimize marketing strategies and maximize revenue. The platform allows\ncompanies to send personalized email marketing campaigns to customers.\n\nThe best thing about Klaviyo is that it comes with predefined automation\ntemplates that work out of the box. Let’s have a look at how you can set up your\nfirst Welcome Series flow.\n\nOnce you sign in to Klaviyo, you will see the following screen:\n\nNext, you’ll have to click on the Flows menu item on the left side of the page.\nFlows are automations that will do the heavy lifting of email marketing for you.\n\nKlaviyo lets you create separate Lists based on multiple criteria.\n\nFor example, you can create a list of:\n\n * People that have ordered a specific product;\n * New users that have signed up to your newsletter;\n * Existing customers that have purchased from you more than two times.\n\nThe possibilities are endless here, but for this example, I am going to consider\nyou simply having the default “New Subscribers” list.\n\nYou will have to click on the “Get Started” button right below the “Welcome\nEmail” card on the Flows screen.\n\nOnce you do that, you’ll see this screen:\n\nGo ahead and select your list, then click on continue.\n\nThe Flow editor will open up, and it looks like this:\n\nBy default, Klaviyo has already added three steps to this Flow:\n\n 1. When a new email gets added to your database, it will instantly receive a\n    Welcome Message.\n 2. After three days from the previous email, that address will receive an\n    additional message.\n 3. After four days from the previous email, that address will receive the last\n    message in this sequence.\n\nNow you want to write and design these emails. You’ll have to click on the first\nemail box, then click edit on the panel on the left.\n\nNow you’ll see a screen that allows you to edit the sender’s name and email\naddress, subject line, and preview text. Once you complete these fields, you can\nclick on the “Edit Content” button to take you to the email content editor page.\n\nAfter creating the first email, you can click on the “Save Content” button. This\nwill take you back to the previous page and save all your progress.\n\nClick “Done” in the top right corner, and you’ll be taken back to the initial\nFlow page.\n\nThe last step you have to take is to set your first email as “Live.” To do so,\nclick on the “Draft” text on the bottom left of the email card and select\n“Live.”\n\nCongratulations! You just configured your first email that will be sent\nautomatically by Klaviyo when a new email address gets added to your list.\n\nNow you have to follow the same steps to finish the other two emails. Once you\nare done, you can click on the “Save & Exit” button in the top right corner:\n\nTo make sure your Flow works, look for a small green dot besides its name in the\nFlows screen:\n\nNow that you have your first Flow, it's time to configure more! After all, you\nwant to automate every aspect of your email marketing efforts completely.\n\nClick on the blue “Create Flow” button in the top right corner of the screen.\n\nAs I previously mentioned, Klaviyo provides a vast template library you can pick\nFlows from.\n\nKlaviyo is a truly comprehensive email marketing tool that can even automate SMS\ncampaigns. Because it has so many features, you might feel lost at first, but\nwith time and a few tutorials, you’ll get the hang of it in no time.\n\nAnother email marketing tool you can use is Mailchimp. The great thing about it\nis that it also acts like a CRM (Customer Relationship Management) platform.\n\nMailchimp [https://mailchimp.com/] - an all in one sales automation tool\nMailchimp is an easy-to-use marketing automation platform for SMBs. You can\ncreate and send email newsletters, manage your subscriber lists, and track\ncampaign performance.\n\nWith Mailchimp, you can automate tasks like welcoming new subscribers,\nre-engaging inactive customers, and following up with people after they buy\nsomething. The platform makes it easy to connect with your audience across\nvarious channels—email, web, mobile, and more—so you can market smarter and grow\nfaster.\n\nMailChimp has many tools to help your business grow, so you can stay organized,\nreach customers wherever they are, sell more stuff, and boost your bottom line.\n\nCreate Signup Forms\n\nGet new subscribers from anywhere on the web, with forms that match the look and\nfeel of your brand.\n\nAnalyze Your Audience Segments\n\nSee which groups of subscribers are opening and clicking on emails, so you can\nfigure out who to send more stuff to.\n\nSend the Right Messages to the Right People\n\nQuickly target segments like first-time buyers or people who abandoned their\ncarts to make sure you're constantly sending relevant messages.\n\nCompared to Klaviyo, Mailchimp might feel a bit more complicated for first-time\nusers.\n\nNow that you know how to automate your email campaigns is time to look at how\nyou can integrate this part of your marketing strategy with your store’s\ninventory. This will not only help your cash flow, but it will open up new\npossibilities you haven’t even thought of.\n\nWorkflow automation\n\nWorkflow automation software is designed to streamline manual processes. For\nexample, your inventory management system needs to interact with both systems if\nyou sell products through your eCommerce website and your brick-and-mortar\nstore.\n\nWorkflow automation software can ensure that inventory quantities in both\nsystems are always correct by performing updates in real-time.\n\nAutomate.io [http://automate.io] - Connect your cloud apps\nAautomate.io helps you connect cloud apps so you can run a series of actions\nautomatically in response to an event.\n\nFor example, whenever you receive an email in Gmail, you can automatically\ncreate a new task in Asana or Trello with automate.io. Or, when a customer\ncompletes a payment in Stripe, you can send them a text message using Twilio.\n\nYou can trigger automated workflows based on events (“trigger app”) that happen\nacross different apps (“connected apps”). Automate.io also lets you perform\nactions (“actions app”) across other connected apps.\n\nIt's called automation because the process happens “automatically” without\nmanual intervention after the initial configuration is done.\n\nZapier [https://zapier.com/] - Free all in one automation tool\nZapier is an online automation tool that connects your favorite apps, such as\nShopify, WooCommerce, Mailchimp, Klaviyo, etc. You can connect two or more apps\nto automate repetitive tasks without coding or relying on developers.\n\nThere are millions of ways you can use Zapier. For example, maybe you want every\nnew customer in Shopify to be automatically added as a subscriber in MailChimp.\nYou'd create a Zap—or an automated workflow—that watches for new customers in\nShopify and adds those people to your MailChimp list. Whenever someone places an\norder in your Shopify store from then on, Zapier will add them to your MailChimp\nlist automatically.\n\nZapier works by watching for triggers in the app where your data starts (for\nexample, a new sale in Shopify), then it automatically performs actions in the\napp where you want to use that data (like adding the sale as a new row in\nExcel).\n\nIf you don’t use Shopify, you have nothing to worry about. Zapier works with\nmost of the biggest eCommerce platforms: WooCommerce, BigCommerce, Wix, and even\neBay or Amazon.\n\nCustomer Relationship Management (CRM) Software\nCustomer support and satisfaction automation refers to software that helps you\nautomatically handle customer support issues or customer satisfaction matters.\n\nSome tools can help you organize customer data so that when a customer needs\nhelp or has a complaint, the service team can quickly locate their information\nwithin your database.\n\nOther types of software provide automated responses to customers' questions or\ncomplaints and can even take on the job of your whole live chat department\n(these are called Chatbots).\n\nHubspot [http://hubspot.com] - The all in one CRM\nHubSpot is the world's leading inbound marketing and sales platform. Over 8,000\ncustomers in more than 90 countries use HubSpot's software, services, and\nsupport to transform how they attract, engage, and delight customers.\n\nA powerful, easy-to-use marketing automation platform that helps small and\nmedium companies get more traffic and leads.\n\nHubSpot Sales includes tools and templates for email outreach and follow-up,\nmeeting scheduling, lead intelligence, and more.\n\nHubSpot Service Hub is a customer service software that helps you deliver a\ndelightful experience at every turn - from your website to your help desk.\n\nThis massive platform has a steep learning curve, so I wouldn’t recommend it if\nyou are just starting. However, the sky is the limit once your systems are in\nplace.\n\nChatfuel [https://chatfuel.com/] - Easiest way to create a chatbot\nChatfuel helps business owners and marketers build Facebook Messenger chatbots\nwithout coding. The Chatfuel platform makes it easy for anyone to engage their\ncustomers and grow their brand from small businesses to large enterprises.\n\nYou can use a chatbot to instantly engage with your website visitors and boost\nyour conversion rate. It doesn’t matter if you have a dedicated live chat team.\nWith the help of a bot, you can reduce the response time to a few seconds and\nconvert more visitors into customers.\n\nSay you run Facebook ads and get a ton of questions regarding your products. You\nhave to spend quite some time answering all of them, plus most people ask you\nthe same thing repeatedly.\n\nWith the help of a bot, you can instantly answer all questions.\n\nWeb Analytics\nEcommerce businesses have access to more data than ever before. Still, they\ndon’t always have the resources or knowledge to turn that data into actionable\ninsights—this is why a web analytics tool is a vital asset for your eCommerce\nmarketing automation stack.\n\nGoogle Analytics [https://analytics.google.com/]\nGoogle Analytics is a free tool designed to help you analyze your marketing\ndata. It collects information about your eCommerce site's visitors and compiles\nreports about the number of visitors, their behaviors, and the effectiveness of\nyour marketing efforts.\n\nYou can use these reports to evaluate your content and make informed decisions\non how to improve your marketing strategies.\n\nHeap [https://heap.io/] - An eCommerce centric analytics platform\nHeap is a customer analytics platform that automatically captures every user\naction on your website and lets you measure it all.\n\nHeap's customer analytics platform tracks every touch, click, tap, swipe, and\ntransaction across your website.

That’s a lot of competition for eCommerce stores looking to\nbuild their own customer base.\n\nBut there’s one thing that separates the winners from the losers: a good\neCommerce platform.\n\nA good eCommerce platform makes it easy for you to manage your customers and\ninventory, add features and integrations, optimize your store for mobile\ndevices, and grow your business to new heights. A great eCommerce platform\ndoesn’t just make it easier for you to create an aesthetically pleasing store—it\ncan help you get more sales as well.\n\nAt WebLime, we build eCommerce websites all the time.\n\nFrom what we’ve seen, the go-to choices are usually Wix, Squarespace, Shopify,\nand WordPress. These are some of the top website builders\n[https://www.weblime.com/stories/top-website-builders] we always recommend for a\nvariety of use cases.\n\nBut which one is best for an eCommerce website? Well, the truth is that it\ndepends. It depends on how complex you want your website to be and the resources\nyou’re willing to invest into it.\n\nWix might be a great place to start if you're just getting started in the world\nof web design. They've made several templates that are super easy to use, and\ntheir online support community is fantastic for beginners.\n\nSquarespace is great for those who want something a bit more professional, but\ndon't need all of the bells and whistles of other platforms.\n\nWordPress offers a lot of options for customization, so if you know exactly what\nyou want but don't know how to code it yourself, this might be the perfect\nplatform for you.\n\nThe truth is that they're all good tools! But they're not all right for every\neCommerce site owner. So, how do you know which one fits you best?\n\nWhat’s the best eCommerce platform for small businesses?\nSmall business owners usually pick Shopify because of its ease of use.\n\nAt the same time, the only Shopify alternatives for building eCommerce websites\nare WordPress and BigCommerce.\n\nWordPress vs Shopify\nThe problem with WordPress is that it's not natively ready for eCommerce. For\nWordPress to support eCommerce, you'll need to install a few plugins. You'll\nusually start with WooCommerce and quickly find yourself adding more plugins to\nthe standard options. And while we typically advocate for WordPress, we stay\naway from it when it comes to eCommerce.\n\nHere's why:\n\nWordPress plugins are typically free, which makes them great for businesses just\nstarting out. But that also means they're not tested or updated as often as\nthose that charge a fee. That often leads to issues further down the road for\nsmall businesses in particular.\n\nThere's not always enough support for the plugins, so you'll need to figure out\nyour own tech issues. We had one client who couldn't get their WordPress store\nworking until we suggested they try another platform entirely. It took one set\nup on Shopify to get them up and running, rather than days of frustration trying\nto get it working on WordPress.\n\nWe decided against using WordPress for our eCommerce clients because we wanted\nsomething that didn't require constant updating and fixing - we wanted something\nthat just worked!\n\nWhile WordPress is certainly capable, it's not the best option when it comes to\neCommerce. While there are plenty of good reasons to stick with it otherwise,\nwhen you want your business to be online and selling products already, choose a\nplatform specifically built for eCommerce instead of trying to learn WordPress\nand having to install a variety of plugins.\n\nBigCommerce vs Shopify\nBigCommerce and Shopify are paving the way for the eCommerce economy. And while\nBigCommerce has its respect, Shopify is the true leader in the space.\n\nThere are many factors to consider when choosing an eCommerce platform, such as\npricing plans, features, integrations, and customer support. BigCommerce and\nShopify are two of the most popular eCommerce platforms on the market today.\nBoth have a lot to offer in terms of design flexibility, third-party\nintegrations, and customer support. BigCommerce is known for its powerful\nback-end features while Shopify is known as one of the best eCommerce platforms\nfor small businesses.\n\nIf you want to build your eCommerce store from scratch, then Shopify is the\nobvious choice. But if you're looking for an enterprise solution and need a lot\nof support—BigCommerce might be a good fit for you. Both platforms are great for\ncreating beautiful online stores with ease.\n\nSo, if you're thinking about starting an online store, it's best to consider\nwhat you're looking for in terms of scalability and development options.\n\nFor example, if you're looking for a platform that will grow with your business\nand allow you to customize your site however you want, Shopify is the better\nchoice.  Shopify's editor is simple, more intuitive, and lets you work with\ncontent blocks.
