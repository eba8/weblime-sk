It’s not like starting a small business from scratch where it’s easier to gain traction from the start. With construction, you’re going up against people who have been in the industry for decades and are used to specific ways of doing things.</p><p>That being said, digital marketing strategies such as search engine optimization (SEO) and pay-per-click (PPC) advertising are useful for putting your construction company ahead of the game. These strategies are proven to get you more leads and help your business thrive!</p><p>But what’s great about these strategies is that they can be used in conjunction with one another to create a well-rounded and effective marketing strategy for your construction company.</p><p>For example, you can use your PPC ads to promote your website or social media profiles. You can then use the content from those pages to create an email newsletter. These are just a few examples of how different strategies can work together to produce leads and grow your construction company.</p><p>A solid marketing strategy for your construction company means more exposure, awareness, and leads. And with more leads comes more profit!</p><p>In this article, we’ll share with you some incredible <a href=\"https://www.weblime.com/stories/construction-marketing-ideas\">construction marketing ideas</a> to help you gain an edge over your competitors. Let’s get started!</p><h3 id=\"why-is-marketing-important\">Why is marketing important?</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://blog.weblime.com/content/images/2022/02/construction-marketing-funnel.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Online construction marketing funnel: Attention, interest, desire, action\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"801\" srcset=\"https://blog.weblime.com/content/images/size/w600/2022/02/construction-marketing-funnel.jpg 600w, https://blog.weblime.com/content/images/size/w1000/2022/02/construction-marketing-funnel.jpg 1000w, https://blog.weblime.com/content/images/2022/02/construction-marketing-funnel.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p>For years I've been sharing the power of marketing for construction companies, whether it be on this blog or through one-on-one consulting. I've found that many owners don't understand the benefits of marketing their business, or they don't know how to market their business effectively. They end up making mistakes that can cost them time and money and, even worse – miss out on new customers!</p><p>Whether working in residential or commercial construction, learning how to market your business will help you attract more clients and win more work.</p><p>When you market your business effectively, it builds brand awareness and perception of value for your products and services. The more people know about your business, the higher the likelihood of gaining new customers.</p><p>Marketing is a way to reach out to potential customers and current clients to keep them engaged with your company. Marketing also shows that you believe in what you do, inspiring trust in your customers.</p><p>It's not just about telling people what you do, but how well you do it, why they need it and who you are. Marketing includes everything from business cards to a full-on marketing campaign. Marketing is essential because:</p><ul><li>You can communicate more effectively with your customers.</li><li>It helps you build your brand identity.</li><li>It makes you stand out from the crowd.</li><li>It creates awareness for your business and its products or services.</li><li>It generates leads that will eventually turn into sales.</li></ul><h3 id=\"construction-marketing-challenges\">Construction marketing challenges</h3><p>It is difficult for a new business to rise in the construction industry. It is especially hard for small construction companies. These businesses have to face competitive challenges from giants which are well established in the market and have strong marketing capability.</p><p>This means that good marketing is crucial for small businesses in the construction industry. You're competing for customers with large corporations, and it can be hard to get their attention when your brand isn't very memorable or distinctive.</p><p>That said, there are still great opportunities in this market because construction is a high-touch customer service business. Construction companies will spend weeks renovating a single house and then sell it to the customer. So they have lots more time than other types of companies to spend on things like customer service and building trust with customers.</p><p>Here are the top five challenges that construction companies face when it comes to their marketing:</p><ol><li>Marketing to real people who want to buy your products. That's not so hard. You can advertise on the web and in print media for free, but you have to make the ads relevant and compelling to actual customers.</li><li>Selling more than one service. That's a chicken-and-egg problem: how do you get people to buy your services when they don't know they exist?</li><li>Building a website that is easy to use and attractive to prospective customers. Designing is easy; actually building it isn't, especially if you have no website development experience.</li><li>Getting your message across in an efficient way. You can hire a professional designer cheaply or do it yourself if you have enough skill with HTML, Photoshop, and other tools. But finding the right message can be more complicated than it seems, especially if you're starting from scratch with a brand new company.</li><li>Making sure that your website shows up high on Google searches for related terms like \"construction services\" or \"construction company.\"</li></ol><h3 id=\"getting-construction-leads-as-a-small-business\">Getting construction leads as a small business</h3><p>If you want to generate more leads for your construction business, you first need to understand your audience.</p><p>For example, if you wanted to sell a small home renovation service, you'd first have to know who would be interested in buying it and where they will be located. Then after securing a few leads, you could ask them why they bought your service. Was it because they saw an ad? A postcard? A friend? This information can help you with future marketing efforts and increase referrals.</p><p>However, as a construction company in a large area, you need to do more than just sell building materials or even finished homes. You need to create a relationship with the customer that lasts for years past the sale date so that when they are ready for another upgrade or addition (and this will happen eventually), they call your company first!</p><p>Some questions to ask yourself are:</p><ul><li>What’s hot right now in construction?</li><li>What are people looking for when they look for a new home or building?</li><li>What is the current style?</li><li>How much are homes selling for right now?</li><li>How much are shopping centers selling for?</li><li>Are there any trends on either consumer or commercial construction?</li></ul><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Ks_vV6B8ZcMNbRROuEGlmWSJmCkzftI6ZBQisSDjcF2-iGjQ9M8uoTm6GuQ9yzrrPGrjOLBKFnQXuhyFWGX4gvY20_m_WqK74nEMa_3imh6ihIMWYDpYia_L9S7IO80yNqQ1nYze\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Construction project with three construction cranes\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>An easy thing to do is simply Google “hot construction trends.” You’ll get a sense of what people are looking for in their homes and what they’re willing to pay more for. If you take that information and use it in your marketing, you’ll start to attract more leads.</p><p>Another great way to keep up with trends is to look at photos of houses with exteriors that have been painted recently. Find colors that seem prevalent in your area, and then do some research to determine why homeowners choose those colors. Is there a new architectural trend that’s driving their decisions? If so, how can you make sure your materials reflect that trend?</p><p>You can also keep up with what's new by following home design blogs for inspiration. Look for colors used together and find ways to incorporate them into your work. If a particular style is gaining popularity in another part of the country or world, consider adding it to your repertoire if it fits in with the neighborhood you’re working in.</p><p>Below, we explore some of the top marketing strategies for your construction company.</p><h3 id=\"encourage-word-of-mouth\">Encourage word of mouth</h3><p>One of the most efficient marketing strategies for local construction businesses is word of mouth.</p><p>There are several ways that you can encourage word of mouth. The first is participating in meetups with your customers (if possible). For example, if you are a home builder, perhaps you can attend the neighborhood block party. If you are in commercial construction, maybe you can host a construction event for other companies with which you work.</p><p>If this isn't possible for the type of business that you run, there are other ways that you can encourage word of mouth. You could consider joining BNI groups or participating in networking events. These are often filled with people who are looking for recommendations for great companies, and once they know about your company, they will undoubtedly spread the word!</p><p>Another way to get more word-of-mouth referrals is to make it easier for your happy customers to refer you by providing them with pre-written testimonials and sample tweets they can use on social media.</p><p>You can also offer discounts and rewards to people who refer your business. For example, you might promise a $50 gift card to anyone who refers a new customer who spends over $1,000 with you.</p><h3 id=\"diversify-your-marketing-channels\">Diversify your marketing channels</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/taCUbLtV41_tx8A1HORDJr5RmD-RClh0X22crycgiSKw8n8GDGZ7TbULLm6sEZhf3lkVmGgY7WT36DOvv-qs0WYAAAc9xWQmhRVHKsQXE-h2crBMLBomgEs3R0iwPXey6W2GHnNB\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"social media icons for construction companies\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>Research shows that consumers use at least ten different channels to find services. It's not enough for a construction business to rely on traditional marketing methods like print and TV ads or word of mouth to spread the word about its services. Instead, owners need to diversify their marketing channels to stay competitive in today's digital world.</p><p>For example, if you only focus on SEO, you'll miss out on all the customers looking for your services on social media or through word of mouth.</p><p>If you're just starting, it's important to choose marketing channels that are most likely to give you a return on investment (ROI). This will help you make sure that your business is sustainable and profitable.</p><p>The best way to find out which channels work best for your business is by experimenting with different options and measuring the results.</p><p>For example, if you run Facebook ads and get a lot of engagement from them, but no one hires you, Facebook isn't working for your business. You can try running ads on another platform instead or investing more money in SEO. You can also hire a marketing consultant who specializes in construction businesses to help guide your strategy to be more effective.</p><h3 id=\"construction-business-ads\">Construction Business Ads</h3><p>PPC marketing for construction companies can help small business owners find new leads while increasing conversion rates and sales.</p><p>Suppose you have a construction website with relevant content about remodeling projects or the services you offer. In that case, it could be displayed as an ad in front of the people searching for what you are offering in your area.</p><p>For example, if someone searches for “remodel my kitchen” in Los Angeles, they will see your ad if they are located close enough to your company and you have bid on that specific keyword phrase with Google AdWords.</p><p>The same principle applies to other forms of paid advertising like Facebook Ads or LinkedIn Ads, where you can target people based on their location, age, gender, and additional personal information they provide.</p><h3 id=\"use-local-seo-to-your-advantage\">Use Local SEO to your advantage</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/EYQTSv7a11lkauUOqtwj7vC8Kb9Hp3GCc9qtjP0JRLLVr3rD6HrX_wrVmkZSpsRNYMkgLzWPzwtXUM3cpN7zeTdofCdlhIVZ_KfgIYXPcY7N9Ryc75qglgt61n27yBilTgXqvKS9\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Computer on desk with google search for SEO\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>A Google search for \"construction companies\" returns over 3 billion results. If you're in the construction business, chances are your competitors are already ranking high in search results and getting potential customers before they even reach you.</p><p>If you aren't already optimizing your website for <a href=\"https://www.weblime.com/stories/how-to-promote-your-business-locally\">local search</a> results (or SEO), it's time to start. You don't have to be an SEO expert; just paying attention to the basics can significantly improve your website's ranking.</p><p>Add yourself to local directories such as Google My Business or Yelp so that customers can find you easily when looking for builders in their local area. By adding your business to these directories, you can also provide information such as opening times, contact information, and directions to your offices which makes it easier for people to get in touch with you or visit you in person if they need help with their home renovation.</p><h3 id=\"use-visual-content-on-social-media\">Use visual content on social media</h3><p>Social media is an essential marketing tool for any business, big or small, and it’s no different for construction companies. Social media allows you to engage with potential customers, promote your services and increase brand awareness of your business overall.</p><p>Start with one social media platform that you feel comfortable using (for example, Facebook or LinkedIn) and build up from there.</p><p>Make sure you add as much visual content as possible, showcasing your work by displaying before and after pictures.</p><h3 id=\"set-up-email-sequences-for-potential-clients\">Set up email sequences for potential clients</h3><p>Businesses that offer construction services are constantly struggling with finding new customers. This is especially true for smaller businesses that don’t have the resources to hire a marketing agency or invest thousands of dollars into advertising campaigns.</p><p>Many construction companies often forget that they might already have a solid email list of potential clients, and they can start marketing to them before they even reach out. This is what we call “email marketing,” and it can be one of the most effective ways to drive leads and sales for your business.</p><p>If you own a construction company, you can use email marketing to:</p><ol><li><strong>Promote your products or services</strong>. You can give your customers or prospects information about any promotions you’re running or any new products or services coming out soon.</li><li><strong>Give industry news and advice</strong>. You can keep them up-to-date on what’s going on in the construction industry and give them tips on how to get the most from your products and services.</li><li><strong>Get feedback from customers</strong>. You can ask for suggestions for new products or services and encourage customers to leave reviews about their experience with your business.</li></ol><h3 id=\"offer-valuable-information-and-be-the-go-to-source\">Offer valuable information and be the go-to source</h3><p>As a construction company, you can build trust with your customers by offering helpful information and being the go-to source for construction projects. This can often be done by creating content and sharing it on social media.</p><p>One way to do this is by creating an informative blog that provides useful information for your target audience. This can be anything from tips on hiring a contractor to new technology in the industry and what trends are happening over time in the market that your target customer is interested in.</p><p>You can also send out monthly newsletters with links back to your website or blog. These newsletters serve as a great way to keep in touch with customers and keep them informed on what’s happening at your business. Ask them if there are any topics they’d like you to cover, and take advantage of this opportunity to answer some of their questions.</p><h3 id=\"ask-for-referrals\">Ask for referrals</h3><p>One efficient way to grow your construction business is through referrals. You can get more referrals by doing any of these:</p><ol><li>Referral cards - tell your customers to refer you to their friends.</li><li>Customer thank you notes - send your customers a handwritten thank you note after every job to build a deeper relationship with them.</li><li>Business cards - give these out to anyone who may need your services in the future.</li><li>Business profile brochure - showcase your company to potential customers.</li><li>Postcards - let everyone in your area know about your business and keep them updated on new jobs you complete or offer specials for new customers.</li></ol><h3 id=\"use-photos-show-off-your-construction-projects-\">Use photos (Show off your construction projects!)</h3><p>It is helpful to include various images that demonstrate different aspects of your business. For example, if you are a kitchen renovator, you may want to include some before and after shots of your undertaken projects. If you are looking to attract the attention of commercial clients, they will be impressed by your past successes as it gives them a flavor of what they can expect from your service.</p><p>Including images in your online portfolio allows potential new customers to learn more about what you do and how you do it. It will enable them to see the quality of your craft and the professional approach that you offer. Customers can judge whether or not they would like to use your service based on the evidence presented in front of them.</p><h3 id=\"call-past-clients-on-a-specific-schedule\">Call past clients on a specific schedule</h3><p>Don't just welcome your new client on board when you sell something. You should also constantly follow up with your previous clients.</p><p>The best way to follow up with your customers is to do so personally and consistently.</p><p>If you have a large customer base, I highly recommend using an automated email marketing platform such as Mailchimp or Keap to ensure that your customer communications are consistent and ongoing.</p><h3 id=\"create-an-authoritative-website\">Create an authoritative website</h3><p>If you haven’t already, you should create a website for your construction business. A good website design is the simplest way to demonstrate your professionalism and values as a company.</p><p>A professional-looking website will give customers confidence in your construction business and increase their likelihood of contacting you. If you don’t want to create a complete website, at least get a landing page created where people can find out more about your business and contact you.</p><p>A website is also a great place to start marketing your construction business. Not only is it a landing page that you can share with potential clients and customers (and provide to other websites), but it’s also an easy way to showcase your construction projects, services, awards, and more. Plus, your website should be built to drive lead generation so that you can easily capture contact information from interested visitors.</p><h3 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h3><p>Marketing is not as complicated as you may think. Just be aware of your goals and needs, then capitalize on your marketing opportunities for an effective way to reach those goals.</p><p>The Internet is a place that can help you in many ways—just make sure you treat it well because it will pay you back big time!</p>","comment_id":"607f231be956ed04e26ff24b","feature_image":"https://blog.weblime.com/content/images/2022/02/Marketing-For-Construction-Companies.png","featured":false,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"none","created_at":"2021-04-20T14:53:15.000-04:00","updated_at":"2022-05-29T20:28:22.000-04:00","published_at":"2021-04-20T15:02:19.000-04:00","custom_excerpt":"Construction businesses all want to get leads.

","slug":"seo-101-the-core-components-you-should-know","feature_image":"https://blog.weblime.com/content/images/2022/02/core-components-seo.png","plaintext":"Search engine optimization (SEO) gives your company a unique opportunity to\nreach potential customers that could not have been reached otherwise. \n\nPut simply, it can help you get found by all those people who didn’t know you\nexisted previously.\n\nSEO can be a powerful tool to gain more exposure in today’s search engines. \n\nPeople may not be aware of it, but statistics show that over 85% of users prefer\nto use search engines rather than any other means of finding information. \n\n75% of people claimed that they wouldn’t purchase without first conducting some\nkind of research online. \n\nThe exciting part is that the percentage of Internet users who look for\ninformation via search engines continues to rise at a fast pace.\n\nThere are many search engine optimization strategies that can prove to be\nsuccessful for you. Some of the ways to improve your search engine rankings\ninclude using specific keywords in the site’s content, referencing high-quality\ninbound links, and making sure you have all of your website information\nsubmitted to the best web directories.\n\nIn this article, we’ll go over the SEO core components you should be familiar\nwith if you want to start optimizing your website.\n\nIntroduction to On-Page SEO\nOn-page SEO can be defined as the process of getting traction on your website by\nimproving your content and links. \n\nAll the on-page SEO features are important for better Google rankings. \n\nTo achieve higher rankings, you need to use clean and informative content, make\nit easy to read and also have the right navigation and elements to help the\nusers find the content in a fast and streamlined manner. \n\nYou want to make sure that it is easy for your users to navigate in and out of\nyour page, otherwise, they will bounce right back where they came from.\n\nThere are three important on-page factors that play an important role in\nachieving higher rankings on Google. \n\nThey are:\n\n * Making sure that your meta tags are optimized for the search engines;\n * Having a clear headings structure on your main website pages;\n * Optimizing your content for the desired focus keywords.\n\nOther on-page elements that are not talked about often but can make you stand\nout from the competition are:\n\n * Links, more specifically building quality inbound links that enhance your\n   site structure;\n * Video embedding, which is an inbound form of video marketing\n * Image optimization, both for visually impaired users and for search engines.\n\nKeyword Research\nBefore you get started with optimizing your content, you need to know how to\nconduct keyword research for your business.\n\nWhat is keyword research and why is it important? \n\nA better question might be, what is keyword research not important for? \n\nFrom buying a new car to getting the latest celebrity gossip or finding\nsomething to eat on a Friday night, keyword research plays an integral part in\nSEO. \n\nSo if your business creates content that you want people to find, then it needs\na core understanding of what its audience looks for.\n\nOne of the most efficient ways to conduct keyword research is to look for\nlong-tail keywords that you can rank for within your niche. This step involves\nbrainstorming ways to approach a keyword and looking at competitors to see what\ntopics they touch upon. \n\nOnce you have a good understanding of what your audience is searching for\nonline, you can start optimizing your pages based on these keywords.\n\nMeta Tags and Headings\nMeta Tags\nThere are two main kinds of meta tags: the meta title and the meta description.\n\nThey are the text snippets that appear on the search engines and they help\nGoogle and users understand what your website is about.\n\nWhile they are not directly correlated with rankings, they do help increase\nclick-through rates if they are compelling and interesting enough.\n\nSome of the best practices for creating meta tags are:\n\n * Add numbers at the beginning of the meta titles;\n * Include the main keyword in both the title and description;\n * Include a call-to-action at the end of the meta description.\n\nHeadings\nOn the other hand, headings help guide the reader.\n\nThey are used to break up the content that is provided on a page. Headings tell\nthe reader what a certain paragraph is about. \n\nThat way, they know whether or not to continue reading. Without them, readers\nwill not know what your content is about. They will become lost in the huge\namount of information you provide, and won't know where to look next.\n\nOptimizing Content\nContent marketing’s importance goes well beyond its importance as just an SEO\ntactic. \n\nIn fact, if you do it right, content marketing produces more leads than PPC. \n\nIt gets you in front of the right people, at the right moment with the right\nmessage – so that when they land on your site through search, they stick around\nand convert.\n\nContent helps establish credibility with your target market and potentially get\nmore subscribers.\n\nMoreover, content marketing is used by companies and businesses that need more\nexposure for their services, products, and solutions. Allowing consumers to\nengage in their product or service for free through content allows you to gain\nSEO traffic and start building trust with potential customers.\n\nDeveloping content which answers a question that people have can be a great way\nto generate leads. Think about it — you search for the keyword ‘choosing an SEO\nagency’ and find content that not only answers your questions but also contains\na form or contact information in which you can get more information.\n\nA few years ago, businesses could simply put together a website and fill it with\nany kind of content to start driving traffic and leads.\n\nIf you were lucky enough to display a pretty picture, it was even better.\nSupposedly, back then a high-quality or interesting website was enough to get\npeople to sign up for your stuff.\n\nNow, you need to take into account more advanced keyword research, competitor\nanalysis, and a much better-organized site structure.\n\nHow to Nail Technical SEO\nLet’s face it, search engine optimization is just as simple or as complicated as\na jigsaw puzzle.\n\nYou have to know the basic elements of SEO, but you have a long way to go before\nyou have a true understanding of how to build traffic to your site. \n\nWithout a steady stream of high-quality traffic, your efforts in promoting your\nbusiness or company in search engines are of little or no value. \n\nFor that reason, having a strong technical foundation is one of the most\nimportant steps for successful SEO.\n\nA lot of people think that technical SEO is limited to just website\narchitecture, but in reality, it’s more than that. \n\nA strong technical foundation is built by having a website crawlable and indexed\neffectively, which includes proper site architecture (internal linking\nstructure) and having a fast loading site.\n\nYou can have a beautiful-looking website with an optimized conversion path that\nranks well in search engines, but if it’s not being crawled or indexed\neffectively your rankings won’t last long.\n\nTechnical SEO Audit\nEvery SEO audit is different but at some point, you're probably going to have to\nrun your website through a few different SEO tools. \n\nIt’s good practice to check the technical health of your website regularly. Each\ntool can tell you something different and each gives you more insight into what\nneeds fixing.\n\nSome great tools for auditing your website are Ahrefs, ScreamingFrog, or\nSEMRush. It’s important to understand that a technical SEO audit will not tell\nyou why your website’s rankings are dropping, but it will serve as a foundation\nof understanding which aspects of your website to change in order to make\nimprovements.\n\nGenerally, technical SEO audits include website performance recommendations and\npage-level optimizations. These internal site changes can initially boost the\nranking of your pages without any internal linking or external link-building\nefforts.\n\nSEO-Friendly Websites\nSo, how do you go ahead and build a website from scratch with SEO in mind?\n\nMost businesses start working on SEO at later stages of development, which puts\nthem behind their competition. Building a website that’s focused on SEO right\nfrom the start can get you ahead of your competitors and give you an unfair\nadvantage.\n\nFor example, H1 tags or meta description tags are something that new websites\noften forget to implement when they start working on SEO. These are easy fixes\nthat can lead to faster page load speed\n[https://www.weblime.com/stories/how-fast-should-a-website-load/] and better\nuser experience.\n\nOther basic technical SEO pieces that you should be aware of are:\n\n * Optimizing your website for mobile devices;\n * Have a clear and well-defined URL structure that doesn’t confuse the search\n   engines and makes it easier for the user to navigate your website. Avoid\n   using unusual characters and keep it simple;\n * 404 pages are fine until they aren’t! Make sure that any 404 pages on your\n   website are redirected to other relevant pages, or at least have a custom 404\n   message displayed. Don’t leave users hanging.\n * Have an SSL certificate installed on your website.\n\nAcquiring High-Quality Backlinks\nLink building is one of the biggest ranking factors. \n\nGoogle states that: \"In general, webmasters can improve the rank of their sites\nby increasing the number of high-quality sites that link to their pages.\" \n\nBy creating awesome, sharable content on your website, you increase your chances\nto get and keep links.\n\nGoogle has estimated that the power of a high-quality backlink (i.e. one that is\n“a canonical link to your site from another high-quality site that has the same\ncontent and comes from a respected domain name that Google recognizes as\noriginating from you”) is about 80 times more powerful than the power of other\nlinks. \n\nFor the average website, building a high-quality link to your website improves\nits rank on Google search.\n\nSo, how do you make sure you strengthen your link profile?\n\nInternal Link Building\nInternal link building refers to passing link juice through the pages on your\nwebsite.\n\nContrary to popular belief, external links are not the most useful ones for\nbuilding your website's SEO. \n\nInstead, internal links are the most beneficial, particularly at the beginning. \n\nThis is because they act as a link equity spreader of sorts. \n\nYou can spread link equity with the help of links, although this isn't so much\nabout establishing a link-friendly structure and attracting links as it is to\nencourage cross-linking within your site. \n\nThis can work for businesses that already have an established presence on the\nweb, as well as e-commerce sites.\n\nExternal Link Building\nExternal links are considered a vital SEO component, and in most cases, the most\neffective form of link building. \n\nThey help to improve the link popularity of your site or blog and can increase\nits search engine rankings. \n\nExternal links are generally considered to carry more value than internal links\nbecause they originate from a different domain that has independent authority. \n\nSo, external links allow your site to benefit in several ways, by:\n\n * increasing popularity through social media sharing;\n * gaining exposure to users who may be interested in your site;\n * influencing search engine rankings and traffic to your target page.\n\nLink Building Best Practices\nLink building doesn’t mean contacting thousands of websites and asking them to\nadd a link to your site.\n\nYou need to consider a few best practices if you want to make the most of your\nlink building efforts:\n\n 1. The website you want to get a link from needs to be highly relevant to your\n    niche. A business site is not relevant to a health site, and vice versa;\n 2. The website also needs to have high authority. Receiving links from random\n    blogs that just launched yesterday won’t help your SEO campaign. Google’s\n    Penguin update shows it is increasingly important to build quality backlinks\n    that provide value to other sites and search engines. It is these backlinks\n    that pass PageRank and overall authority from site to site.\n 3. Pay attention to your anchor texts. Anchor texts are one of the most\n    important aspects of off-page SEO. These texts are displayed on each link to\n    your website and draw the visitors’ attention. Most guides, including\n    Google's Webmaster guidelines, recommend creating various anchor text\n    variations, as it will make your backlinks look natural and avoid keyword\n    stuffing.\n\nConclusion\nAs an SEO, you don’t have to know everything. \n\nYou can focus on just a few key terms every week and still be profitable,\ndepending on how competitive your niche is. \n\nSimple enhancements and improvements to a website can yield excellent results.\nGetting your first rankings and watching your traffic climb can provide a great\ndeal of motivation to continue in the SEO game.","excerpt":"Search engine optimization (SEO) gives your company a unique opportunity to reach potential customers that could not have been reached otherwise.

It’s not like starting a small business from scratch where it’s\neasier to gain traction from the start. With construction, you’re going up\nagainst people who have been in the industry for decades and are used to\nspecific ways of doing things.\n\nThat being said, digital marketing strategies such as search engine optimization\n(SEO) and pay-per-click (PPC) advertising are useful for putting your\nconstruction company ahead of the game. These strategies are proven to get you\nmore leads and help your business thrive!\n\nBut what’s great about these strategies is that they can be used in conjunction\nwith one another to create a well-rounded and effective marketing strategy for\nyour construction company.\n\nFor example, you can use your PPC ads to promote your website or social media\nprofiles. You can then use the content from those pages to create an email\nnewsletter. These are just a few examples of how different strategies can work\ntogether to produce leads and grow your construction company.\n\nA solid marketing strategy for your construction company means more exposure,\nawareness, and leads. And with more leads comes more profit!\n\nIn this article, we’ll share with you some incredible construction marketing\nideas [https://www.weblime.com/stories/construction-marketing-ideas] to help you\ngain an edge over your competitors. Let’s get started!\n\nWhy is marketing important?\nFor years I've been sharing the power of marketing for construction companies,\nwhether it be on this blog or through one-on-one consulting. I've found that\nmany owners don't understand the benefits of marketing their business, or they\ndon't know how to market their business effectively. They end up making mistakes\nthat can cost them time and money and, even worse – miss out on new customers!\n\nWhether working in residential or commercial construction, learning how to\nmarket your business will help you attract more clients and win more work.\n\nWhen you market your business effectively, it builds brand awareness and\nperception of value for your products and services. The more people know about\nyour business, the higher the likelihood of gaining new customers.\n\nMarketing is a way to reach out to potential customers and current clients to\nkeep them engaged with your company. Marketing also shows that you believe in\nwhat you do, inspiring trust in your customers.\n\nIt's not just about telling people what you do, but how well you do it, why they\nneed it and who you are. Marketing includes everything from business cards to a\nfull-on marketing campaign. Marketing is essential because:\n\n * You can communicate more effectively with your customers.\n * It helps you build your brand identity.\n * It makes you stand out from the crowd.\n * It creates awareness for your business and its products or services.\n * It generates leads that will eventually turn into sales.\n\nConstruction marketing challenges\nIt is difficult for a new business to rise in the construction industry. It is\nespecially hard for small construction companies. These businesses have to face\ncompetitive challenges from giants which are well established in the market and\nhave strong marketing capability.\n\nThis means that good marketing is crucial for small businesses in the\nconstruction industry. You're competing for customers with large corporations,\nand it can be hard to get their attention when your brand isn't very memorable\nor distinctive.\n\nThat said, there are still great opportunities in this market because\nconstruction is a high-touch customer service business. Construction companies\nwill spend weeks renovating a single house and then sell it to the customer. So\nthey have lots more time than other types of companies to spend on things like\ncustomer service and building trust with customers.\n\nHere are the top five challenges that construction companies face when it comes\nto their marketing:\n\n 1. Marketing to real people who want to buy your products. That's not so hard.\n    You can advertise on the web and in print media for free, but you have to\n    make the ads relevant and compelling to actual customers.\n 2. Selling more than one service. That's a chicken-and-egg problem: how do you\n    get people to buy your services when they don't know they exist?\n 3. Building a website that is easy to use and attractive to prospective\n    customers. Designing is easy; actually building it isn't, especially if you\n    have no website development experience.\n 4. Getting your message across in an efficient way. You can hire a professional\n    designer cheaply or do it yourself if you have enough skill with HTML,\n    Photoshop, and other tools. But finding the right message can be more\n    complicated than it seems, especially if you're starting from scratch with a\n    brand new company.\n 5. Making sure that your website shows up high on Google searches for related\n    terms like \"construction services\" or \"construction company.\"\n\nGetting construction leads as a small business\nIf you want to generate more leads for your construction business, you first\nneed to understand your audience.\n\nFor example, if you wanted to sell a small home renovation service, you'd first\nhave to know who would be interested in buying it and where they will be\nlocated. Then after securing a few leads, you could ask them why they bought\nyour service. Was it because they saw an ad? A postcard? A friend? This\ninformation can help you with future marketing efforts and increase referrals.\n\nHowever, as a construction company in a large area, you need to do more than\njust sell building materials or even finished homes. You need to create a\nrelationship with the customer that lasts for years past the sale date so that\nwhen they are ready for another upgrade or addition (and this will happen\neventually), they call your company first!\n\nSome questions to ask yourself are:\n\n * What’s hot right now in construction?\n * What are people looking for when they look for a new home or building?\n * What is the current style?\n * How much are homes selling for right now?\n * How much are shopping centers selling for?\n * Are there any trends on either consumer or commercial construction?\n\nAn easy thing to do is simply Google “hot construction trends.” You’ll get a\nsense of what people are looking for in their homes and what they’re willing to\npay more for. If you take that information and use it in your marketing, you’ll\nstart to attract more leads.\n\nAnother great way to keep up with trends is to look at photos of houses with\nexteriors that have been painted recently. Find colors that seem prevalent in\nyour area, and then do some research to determine why homeowners choose those\ncolors. Is there a new architectural trend that’s driving their decisions? If\nso, how can you make sure your materials reflect that trend?\n\nYou can also keep up with what's new by following home design blogs for\ninspiration. Look for colors used together and find ways to incorporate them\ninto your work. If a particular style is gaining popularity in another part of\nthe country or world, consider adding it to your repertoire if it fits in with\nthe neighborhood you’re working in.\n\nBelow, we explore some of the top marketing strategies for your construction\ncompany.\n\nEncourage word of mouth\nOne of the most efficient marketing strategies for local construction businesses\nis word of mouth.\n\nThere are several ways that you can encourage word of mouth. The first is\nparticipating in meetups with your customers (if possible). For example, if you\nare a home builder, perhaps you can attend the neighborhood block party. If you\nare in commercial construction, maybe you can host a construction event for\nother companies with which you work.\n\nIf this isn't possible for the type of business that you run, there are other\nways that you can encourage word of mouth. You could consider joining BNI groups\nor participating in networking events. These are often filled with people who\nare looking for recommendations for great companies, and once they know about\nyour company, they will undoubtedly spread the word!\n\nAnother way to get more word-of-mouth referrals is to make it easier for your\nhappy customers to refer you by providing them with pre-written testimonials and\nsample tweets they can use on social media.\n\nYou can also offer discounts and rewards to people who refer your business. For\nexample, you might promise a $50 gift card to anyone who refers a new customer\nwho spends over $1,000 with you.\n\nDiversify your marketing channels\nResearch shows that consumers use at least ten different channels to find\nservices. It's not enough for a construction business to rely on traditional\nmarketing methods like print and TV ads or word of mouth to spread the word\nabout its services. Instead, owners need to diversify their marketing channels\nto stay competitive in today's digital world.\n\nFor example, if you only focus on SEO, you'll miss out on all the customers\nlooking for your services on social media or through word of mouth.\n\nIf you're just starting, it's important to choose marketing channels that are\nmost likely to give you a return on investment (ROI). This will help you make\nsure that your business is sustainable and profitable.\n\nThe best way to find out which channels work best for your business is by\nexperimenting with different options and measuring the results.\n\nFor example, if you run Facebook ads and get a lot of engagement from them, but\nno one hires you, Facebook isn't working for your business. You can try running\nads on another platform instead or investing more money in SEO. You can also\nhire a marketing consultant who specializes in construction businesses to help\nguide your strategy to be more effective.\n\nConstruction Business Ads\nPPC marketing for construction companies can help small business owners find new\nleads while increasing conversion rates and sales.\n\nSuppose you have a construction website with relevant content about remodeling\nprojects or the services you offer. In that case, it could be displayed as an ad\nin front of the people searching for what you are offering in your area.\n\nFor example, if someone searches for “remodel my kitchen” in Los Angeles, they\nwill see your ad if they are located close enough to your company and you have\nbid on that specific keyword phrase with Google AdWords.\n\nThe same principle applies to other forms of paid advertising like Facebook Ads\nor LinkedIn Ads, where you can target people based on their location, age,\ngender, and additional personal information they provide.\n\nUse Local SEO to your advantage\nA Google search for \"construction companies\" returns over 3 billion results. If\nyou're in the construction business, chances are your competitors are already\nranking high in search results and getting potential customers before they even\nreach you.\n\nIf you aren't already optimizing your website for local search\n[https://www.weblime.com/stories/how-to-promote-your-business-locally] results\n(or SEO), it's time to start. You don't have to be an SEO expert; just paying\nattention to the basics can significantly improve your website's ranking.\n\nAdd yourself to local directories such as Google My Business or Yelp so that\ncustomers can find you easily when looking for builders in their local area. By\nadding your business to these directories, you can also provide information such\nas opening times, contact information, and directions to your offices which\nmakes it easier for people to get in touch with you or visit you in person if\nthey need help with their home renovation.\n\nUse visual content on social media\nSocial media is an essential marketing tool for any business, big or small, and\nit’s no different for construction companies. Social media allows you to engage\nwith potential customers, promote your services and increase brand awareness of\nyour business overall.\n\nStart with one social media platform that you feel comfortable using (for\nexample, Facebook or LinkedIn) and build up from there.\n\nMake sure you add as much visual content as possible, showcasing your work by\ndisplaying before and after pictures.\n\nSet up email sequences for potential clients\nBusinesses that offer construction services are constantly struggling with\nfinding new customers. This is especially true for smaller businesses that don’t\nhave the resources to hire a marketing agency or invest thousands of dollars\ninto advertising campaigns.\n\nMany construction companies often forget that they might already have a solid\nemail list of potential clients, and they can start marketing to them before\nthey even reach out. This is what we call “email marketing,” and it can be one\nof the most effective ways to drive leads and sales for your business.\n\nIf you own a construction company, you can use email marketing to:\n\n 1. Promote your products or services. You can give your customers or prospects\n    information about any promotions you’re running or any new products or\n    services coming out soon.\n 2. Give industry news and advice. You can keep them up-to-date on what’s going\n    on in the construction industry and give them tips on how to get the most\n    from your products and services.\n 3. Get feedback from customers. You can ask for suggestions for new products or\n    services and encourage customers to leave reviews about their experience\n    with your business.\n\nOffer valuable information and be the go-to source\nAs a construction company, you can build trust with your customers by offering\nhelpful information and being the go-to source for construction projects. This\ncan often be done by creating content and sharing it on social media.\n\nOne way to do this is by creating an informative blog that provides useful\ninformation for your target audience. This can be anything from tips on hiring a\ncontractor to new technology in the industry and what trends are happening over\ntime in the market that your target customer is interested in.\n\nYou can also send out monthly newsletters with links back to your website or\nblog. These newsletters serve as a great way to keep in touch with customers and\nkeep them informed on what’s happening at your business. Ask them if there are\nany topics they’d like you to cover, and take advantage of this opportunity to\nanswer some of their questions.\n\nAsk for referrals\nOne efficient way to grow your construction business is through referrals. You\ncan get more referrals by doing any of these:\n\n 1. Referral cards - tell your customers to refer you to their friends.\n 2. Customer thank you notes - send your customers a handwritten thank you note\n    after every job to build a deeper relationship with them.\n 3. Business cards - give these out to anyone who may need your services in the\n    future.\n 4. Business profile brochure - showcase your company to potential customers.\n 5. Postcards - let everyone in your area know about your business and keep them\n    updated on new jobs you complete or offer specials for new customers.\n\nUse photos (Show off your construction projects!)\nIt is helpful to include various images that demonstrate different aspects of\nyour business. For example, if you are a kitchen renovator, you may want to\ninclude some before and after shots of your undertaken projects. If you are\nlooking to attract the attention of commercial clients, they will be impressed\nby your past successes as it gives them a flavor of what they can expect from\nyour service.\n\nIncluding images in your online portfolio allows potential new customers to\nlearn more about what you do and how you do it. It will enable them to see the\nquality of your craft and the professional approach that you offer. Customers\ncan judge whether or not they would like to use your service based on the\nevidence presented in front of them.\n\nCall past clients on a specific schedule\nDon't just welcome your new client on board when you sell something. You should\nalso constantly follow up with your previous clients.\n\nThe best way to follow up with your customers is to do so personally and\nconsistently.\n\nIf you have a large customer base, I highly recommend using an automated email\nmarketing platform such as Mailchimp or Keap to ensure that your customer\ncommunications are consistent and ongoing.\n\nCreate an authoritative website\nIf you haven’t already, you should create a website for your construction\nbusiness. A good website design is the simplest way to demonstrate your\nprofessionalism and values as a company.\n\nA professional-looking website will give customers confidence in your\nconstruction business and increase their likelihood of contacting you. If you\ndon’t want to create a complete website, at least get a landing page created\nwhere people can find out more about your business and contact you.\n\nA website is also a great place to start marketing your construction business.\nNot only is it a landing page that you can share with potential clients and\ncustomers (and provide to other websites), but it’s also an easy way to showcase\nyour construction projects, services, awards, and more. Plus, your website\nshould be built to drive lead generation so that you can easily capture contact\ninformation from interested visitors.\n\nConclusion\nMarketing is not as complicated as you may think. Just be aware of your goals\nand needs, then capitalize on your marketing opportunities for an effective way\nto reach those goals.\n\nThe Internet is a place that can help you in many ways—just make sure you treat\nit well because it will pay you back big time!","excerpt":"Construction businesses all want to get leads.
