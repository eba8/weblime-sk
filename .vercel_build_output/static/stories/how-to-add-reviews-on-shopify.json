A study conducted by Nielsen discovered that 73% of online respondents use reviews to make purchase decisions.</p><p>The research from Nielsen says it all - reviews are super important to your business. But why?</p><p>How do reviews create trust? It’s hard to buy something when you don’t know what you are getting into. Reviews help reduce the perceived risk. A customer looking at a product on your Shopify store will estimate their risk in terms of the probability that they may have a bad experience.</p><p>All things being equal, products with many customer reviews are seen as low-risk purchases, while products with few or no reviews are considered high-risk products. Reviews also help craft an image of your brand and educate potential customers about who you are as a business and what you want them to know about your products. This can only be good for business!</p><p>Now that you know how critical reviews are let’s look at how you can easily incorporate them into your Shopify store.</p><h3 id=\"how-to-add-a-product-reviews-app-on-shopify\">How to add a product reviews app on Shopify</h3><p>Installing a product reviews app is the best and fastest way to <strong>add reviews to your Shopify store</strong>. Here’s a detailed guide on how to add a review app to your Shopify store:</p><ol><li><strong>Go to the <a href=\"https://apps.shopify.com/search?q=review\">Shopify App Store</a> and search for “review” and click on the app you want to install.</strong></li></ol><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-cs5fn4qkxSFdbiD4rhuDE9xtFJizAGUSDikNFGIJIfENzKt5Dk4bDDrYlswMRowmXTGF_Dbr2o1mWK9KRsjvEK5CYPg6OBnE56Ft8fqwK1QYdK0cuZu2CSyaq5F-2zmeQtUatUy\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Shopify app store showing results for reviews apps\" loading=\"lazy\"></figure><p>This is the screen you will see right after you search for the term “review”.

You should be careful to not send this email too soon. After all, they can’t review a product they have not yet received.</p><p>Most apps from this list let you send automatic emails after a specific time has passed since your customers have placed the order. You should make sure that this delay is no less than a week.</p><h3 id=\"send-sms-messages-to-your-customers\">Send SMS messages to your customers</h3><p>A more intrusive method of asking your customers for reviews is via SMS. You should already have your customer’s phone numbers, so sending an SMS shouldn’t be more difficult than sending an email.</p><p>This method might seem like a bit too much for some people, but it can generate way more reviews than simply sending an email.</p><h3 id=\"use-social-media-for-social-proof\">Use social media for social proof</h3><p>This method revolves around business reviews rather than specific product ones. People don’t just need to know if your products are good, but if your online store is trustworthy or not.</p><p>Getting reviews on Facebook about your customer service, shipping times, and warranties is a great way to boost traffic, increase conversions and improve your <strong>social proof</strong>. You can simply post on social media asking your followers to leave a review. You can even offer a 10% discount if they do so.</p><h3 id=\"add-a-thank-you-note-in-the-package\">Add a Thank You note in the package</h3><p>Last but not least, this method is all about directly communicating with a customer right when they first open their package.</p><p>You can add a simple thank you note printed as a flyer right inside the box you used to ship out your orders. This is a great way of thanking your customers for their order and incentivizing them to leave a positive review of your business.</p><h3 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h3><p>Reviews are a sure way to increase users’ trust and boost conversions. They are the backbone of any Shopify store as they let people get to know what others think of your products and business as a whole.</p><p>Regardless of the app you choose, make sure to spend enough time getting to understand how it works.
