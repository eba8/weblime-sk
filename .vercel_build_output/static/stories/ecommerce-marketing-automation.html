<!--kg-card-end: html--><p>As your eCommerce business grows, so do your marketing needs. Marketing automation tools are supposed to help you prioritize and handle the many different pieces of your online campaigns. eCommerce companies are growing in number at an astonishing rate, and separating yourself from your competitors requires a well-planned out strategy.</p><p>Attracting new users and converting them into paying customers is a top priority for every eCommerce business. But once you’ve given them your product, how can you make sure they come back?</p><p>You’ll need to analyze your website's metrics, keep track of visitors, communicate with potential customers, and the list goes on.</p><p>This article will cover the principles of eCommerce marketing automation and how it can make your life easier while your business grows to new levels.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://blog.weblime.com/content/images/2022/05/ecommerce-marketing-automation.png" class="kg-image" alt="4 components of eCommerce marketing automation" loading="lazy" width="1080" height="1080" srcset="https://blog.weblime.com/content/images/size/w600/2022/05/ecommerce-marketing-automation.png 600w, https://blog.weblime.com/content/images/size/w1000/2022/05/ecommerce-marketing-automation.png 1000w, https://blog.weblime.com/content/images/2022/05/ecommerce-marketing-automation.png 1080w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><h3 id="what-is-ecommerce-marketing-automation">What is eCommerce marketing automation?</h3><p>Ecommerce marketing automation refers to software built to automate repetitive marketing tasks. This includes following up with leads, sending e-mails, and collecting information.</p><p>Automating your eCommerce marketing can help you free up time by creating and launching campaigns. The days when you had to hire people for mundane tasks are long gone. Developers and companies have created software that will remove the blood, sweat, and tears from repetitive tasks so you can focus on other aspects of your business.</p><h3 id="what-does-ecommerce-marketing-automation-include">What does eCommerce marketing automation include?</h3><p>Automation takes care of <strong>marketing</strong> and <strong>sales engagement</strong> while driving <a href="https://www.weblime.com/stories/ecommerce-dashboard">measurable results</a>. It allows you to easily design, execute, and automate your campaigns or tasks across multiple departments. You can simultaneously scale up your marketing efforts while achieving a consistent customer experience.</p><p>Automation software comes in many different forms. Some simplify workflows, while others tackle analysis. Let's take a closer look at four of the most valuable types of automation software.</p><p><strong>Marketing Automation Software</strong></p><p>Marketing automation software is all about simplifying and streamlining your marketing processes. For example, you can use it to automate repetitive tasks like email campaigns. Marketing <a href="https://www.weblime.com/stories/shopify-automation">automation tools</a> also help track and analyze marketing and sales data to easily get a big picture view of all your marketing endeavors.</p><p><strong>Workflow automation</strong></p><p>High-volume retailers often use workflow automation tools to ensure their orders are processed efficiently. Workflow automation software can automatically update systems when orders are shipped or returned, track inventory, and make sure customers are billed correctly. Some workflow automation tools can also make recommendations based on past performance and projected demand.</p><p><strong>Customer Relationship Management (CRM) Software</strong></p><p>CRM software deals with customer interactions on an individual level. This is where you'll find information about customers' details, contact information, and order histories. It also allows you to send personalized emails, messages, and promotions to specific customers based on their actions or data. Because of this, CRM helps improve customer relations significantly by assisting companies in sending the right message to the right person at the right time.</p><p><strong>Web Analytics Software</strong></p><p>Web Analytics is where you find data about how visitors interact with your website or online store. Tracking metrics like bounce rate, page views per visit, and time on site are essential for understanding which pages are working best and which ones need improvement. With data from web analytics software, you can calculate how well your campaigns are performing and how good your website’s UI/UX is.</p><h3 id="best-ecommerce-automation-tools">Best eCommerce Automation Tools</h3><p>Now that you know the main categories of eCommerce marketing automation its time to have a closer look at some of the best tools out there.</p><p><strong>Email Marketing Automation Tools</strong></p><p>To recap, email marketing automation is a way to deliver emails to customers based on their behaviors. You can also segment users based on demographics, such as age, location, or behavior.</p><p>Some examples of email marketing automation include:</p><p><strong>Abandoned Cart Emails</strong></p><p>Many users tend to add a product to their carts and never really finish the checkout process. They might want to save their cart for later, but they simply forget about it in most cases.</p><p>Instead of losing these customers, you can set up an abandoned cart email campaign that will automatically send out a message reminding users about the products they never really purchased. This can help you increase sales for an extremely low cost, and it’s all automatic.</p><p><strong>Cross-sell and Upsell Emails</strong></p><p>After users purchase a product from your store, they will most likely receive a confirmation email. This is usually autogenerated by the <strong>eCommerce platform</strong> you are using. But after they get this initial email, most people never hear back from the store they just purchased from.</p><p>A cross-sell or upsell email campaign automatically sends out a message to your previous customers so they can come back and buy again. When you set up such a campaign, you want to make sure that you also include an incentive (like a discount coupon) so people will be more likely to reorder from your store.</p><p>Remember, previous customers are more likely to purchase from you than new users. This happens because they already trust your business and know that there is nothing to worry about.</p><p><strong>Customer Engagement Emails</strong></p><p>If your store allows users to create an account, you should have a bunch of useful information about them. Customer engagement emails are a great way to strengthen the relationship between your business and users by sending them a “Happy Birthday” message with a special discount.</p><p>Building this relationship will turn customers into brand advocates who will recommend your store to their friends and family.</p><p><strong>Promotional Emails</strong></p><p>Say you have ordered a large quantity of a specific product because your supplier had a great offer. You now decide to run a campaign and apply a discount to that particular product or category.</p><p>The best and cheapest way to boost your sales is to set up a promotional email campaign and let everyone on your list know about your offer.</p><p>On the other hand, if your stock runs low on a product and you want to get rid of it to buy its new variant, you can send out a message to your list letting them know about it.</p><h4 id="klaviyomost-accessible-email-marketing-automation-tool"><strong><a href="https://www.klaviyo.com/">Klaviyo</a> - most accessible email marketing automation tool</strong></h4><p>Klaviyo helps e‑commerce businesses collect, analyze and use customer data to optimize marketing strategies and maximize revenue.

Some simplify workflows, while others tackle analysis. Let's take a closer look at four of the most valuable types of automation software.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Marketing Automation Software\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Marketing automation software is all about simplifying and streamlining your marketing processes. For example, you can use it to automate repetitive tasks like email campaigns. Marketing \u003Ca href=\\\"https://www.weblime.com/stories/shopify-automation\\\">automation tools\u003C/a> also help track and analyze marketing and sales data to easily get a big picture view of all your marketing endeavors.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Workflow automation\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\u003Cp>High-volume retailers often use workflow automation tools to ensure their orders are processed efficiently. Workflow automation software can automatically update systems when orders are shipped or returned, track inventory, and make sure customers are billed correctly. Some workflow automation tools can also make recommendations based on past performance and projected demand.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Customer Relationship Management (CRM) Software\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\u003Cp>CRM software deals with customer interactions on an individual level. This is where you'll find information about customers' details, contact information, and order histories. It also allows you to send personalized emails, messages, and promotions to specific customers based on their actions or data. Because of this, CRM helps improve customer relations significantly by assisting companies in sending the right message to the right person at the right time.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Web Analytics Software\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Web Analytics is where you find data about how visitors interact with your website or online store.

With data from web analytics software, you can calculate how well your campaigns are performing and how good your website’s UI/UX is.\u003C/p>\u003Ch3 id=\\\"best-ecommerce-automation-tools\\\">Best eCommerce Automation Tools\u003C/h3>\u003Cp>Now that you know the main categories of eCommerce marketing automation its time to have a closer look at some of the best tools out there.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Email Marketing Automation Tools\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\u003Cp>To recap, email marketing automation is a way to deliver emails to customers based on their behaviors. You can also segment users based on demographics, such as age, location, or behavior.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Some examples of email marketing automation include:\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Abandoned Cart Emails\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Many users tend to add a product to their carts and never really finish the checkout process. They might want to save their cart for later, but they simply forget about it in most cases.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Instead of losing these customers, you can set up an abandoned cart email campaign that will automatically send out a message reminding users about the products they never really purchased. This can help you increase sales for an extremely low cost, and it’s all automatic.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Cross-sell and Upsell Emails\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\u003Cp>After users purchase a product from your store, they will most likely receive a confirmation email. This is usually autogenerated by the \u003Cstrong>eCommerce platform\u003C/strong> you are using. But after they get this initial email, most people never hear back from the store they just purchased from.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>A cross-sell or upsell email campaign automatically sends out a message to your previous customers so they can come back and buy again. When you set up such a campaign, you want to make sure that you also include an incentive (like a discount coupon) so people will be more likely to reorder from your store.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Remember, previous customers are more likely to purchase from you than new users.
