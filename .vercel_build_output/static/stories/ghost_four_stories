There's no built-in way to update your posts or schedule\npages for email outreach automatically; for example, you have to do everything\nyourself manually. And when it comes to lead generation and sales funnels made\nup of multiple steps, WordPress is hardly the most efficient tool around.\n\nIt's also essential to keep a healthy WordPress installation while working on\nautomation. It's easy to keep adding plugins and features and find yourself with\na bloated setup.

We're going to cover everything you need to know!","slug":"shopify-vs-amazon","plaintext":"Looking to start your own online business? It's a special moment.\n\nThis is your business. Your 9-5 (or maybe 6-11). You want nothing but the best\nfor it. And part of that means choosing the right platform to set up shop.\nNaturally, your decision comes down to the two industry titans: Amazon vs\nShopify.\n\nWhile both eCommerce platforms allow third-party vendors to sell their products,\nShopify and Amazon have some important distinctions that you need to consider\nbefore launching your own eCommerce business.\n\nAt Weblime [https://www.weblime.com/], we're going to cover everything you need\nto know about both with in-depth reviews so you can decide which ecommerce\nplatform is best for you.\n\nShopify vs Amazon: Key differences\n * While Shopify is a specialized ecommerce platform, Amazon is more of an\n   online marketplace. On Shopify, you can build your own standalone online\n   store from the ground up. But on Amazon, you're selling products on the\n   Amazon marketplace, where millions of people shop already, alongside other\n   third-party sellers. So while you need to build an audience for your Shopify\n   store (a private entity), you're tapping into an audience with Amazon FBA (a\n   public marketplace).\n * Shopify is brand-centric, Amazon is Amazon-centric. On Shopify, you're\n   building your own brand – a separate entity. That means investing in\n   long-term digital marketing\n   [https://www.weblime.com/stories/ultimate-guide-to-digital-marketing/] \n   efforts on social media, search engines (SEO\n   [https://www.embarque.io/post/global-seo]), and handling public relations.\n   Customer service is also your responsibility and reflects on your brand\n   image. But with Amazon, merchants give up most of the spotlight (branding,\n   custom design, customer support) while they collect sales revenue behind the\n   curtain.\n * Shopify is more hands-on (lower costs), Amazon is more hands-off (higher\n   costs). To build and operate your own online store using Shopify's ecommerce\n   tools, \n   [https://www.shopify.ca/pricing?term=shopify%20plans&adid=565729915161&campaignid=15436644442&branded_enterprise=1&BOID=brand&gclid=CjwKCAjwsJ6TBhAIEiwAfl4TWMnOHbcP09pf9RwKyAZPOjoJAc-38rmjIUOemp-avZ_mqcrythFKrhoCiqYQAvD_BwE&cmadid=516586854;cmadvertiserid=10730501;cmcampaignid=26990768;cmplacementid=324494812;cmcreativeid=163722649;cmsiteid=5500011]\n   monthly subscriptions are available for different sized businesses. You'll\n   need to find your own suppliers (through Aliexpress, Alibaba, or Zendrop,\n   etc.), monitor product delivery, and handle customer service issues. With\n   Amazon everything from product insurance, care, delivery, customer service,\n   and overall management is taken care of. You just have to supply product\n   media and copy, along with paying recurring costs like your selling plan,\n   referral fees, fulfillment fees , and other expenses like long-term storage.\n\nWhat is Shopify?\nShopify is a Canadian eCommerce company founded in 2006 by Tobias Lütke, Daniel\nWeinand, and Scott Lake. Their bread and butter is pretty straightforward: an\neCommerce platform for businesses of all sizes to create an online store. It's\nused by some of the world's largest brands, including Tesla, General Electric,\nBudweiser, Red Bull, and Nestle.\n\nShopify’s key features:\n 1. A customizable platform: Shopify offers users a customizable platform to\n    build their own online store. You can choose from a variety of Shopify\n    themes or hire a professional team\n    [https://www.weblime.com/stories/shopify-marketing-agency/] to add custom\n    code to personalize the look and feel you want for your online store. And\n    with the Shopify App store, you can add all sorts of nifty\n    conversion-boosting features and functionalities.\n 2. Wide range of integrations: Shopify's interface is designed to be\n    easy-to-use because 99% of applications don't need technical experience,\n    thanks to integrations. For example, with Google and Facebook, you can\n    easily set up your traffic and audience engagement trackers (pixels), which\n    normally involve coding knowledge. Other plugins can help you automate\n    repetitive processes [https://www.weblime.com/stories/shopify-automation/].\n 3. Integrated email marketing: With Shopify, you can send automated emails to\n    your customers based on their interactions with your store. For example, you\n    can set up an abandoned cart email campaign to recover lost sales, a\n    customer retention email series to keep your customers engaged, and\n    post-purchase emails to cross-sell or upsell products. All of these are\n    customizable and require no coding knowledge.\n 4. A built-in blog: Shopify has a built-in blogging feature that lets you\n    easily create content to drive traffic and engage your customers. You can\n    write blog posts, create product pages, and add other types of content to\n    your store. And with Shopify's SEO features, you can optimize your content\n    so that it ranks higher in search engines.\n 5. Shopify payments: With Shopify Payments, you can accept credit cards and\n    other forms of payment on your store without having to set up a third-party\n    payment processor. Shopify Payments is available in the US, Canada, UK,\n    Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, and Singapore.\n\nAlthough you can edit your store page and navigate rather intuitively on Amazon,\nit simply doesn't offer the same suite of store and brand-building tools because\nagain, Amazon isn't too focused on providing third-party merchants personal\nbranding power.\n\nShopify Pricing\nShopify offers 3 pricing plans:\n\n * Basic Shopify: $29/month (for new ecommerce businesses)\n * Shopify: $79/month (best for growing businesses)\n * Advanced Shopify: $299/month (best for scaling businesses)\n\nEach plan progressively offers lower credit card rates for cheaper payment\nprocessing, larger shipping discounts, more staff accounts, advanced reports,\ntax management, and international pricing tools.\n\nPros of Shopify\n * Very intuitive to use. Shopify is one of the most user-friendly software\n   applications out there. You can add products, customize your store pages, set\n   up shipping and taxes, and more without having to touch a single line of\n   code.\n * Large variety of storefront themes. Online sellers can customize their stores\n   any way they want with a wide range of both free and paid themes to choose\n   from. And if you're not satisfied with any of the available themes, you can\n   always hire a Shopify Expert to create a custom theme for you.\n * Helps streamline your marketing and discounts. On Shopify, you can easily\n   generate discount codes, create separate SEO headings and descriptions, send\n   emails, and track your store's analytics all in one place. There are a ton of \n   automation tools to help boost your sales too\n   [https://www.weblime.com/stories/ecommerce-marketing-automation/].\n * There's a Shopify app store (with a lot of apps). Some online businesses\n   swear by particular apps that have single-handedly supercharged their sales.\n   One example is SMS bump (text marketing). Shopify gives your online store\n   access to thousands of unique apps that allow you to take your customer\n   experience and business management to a new level.\n * Fantastic customer support. One of the things that sets Shopify apart from\n   other ecommerce platforms is its excellent customer support. Whenever you\n   have a question or run into a problem, you can always contact Shopify's\n   support team 24/7 via live chat, email, or phone.\n\nCons of Shopify\n * Limited control over some aspects of your store. Because Shopify is a hosted\n   platform, you can't make any changes to the server-side code or add custom\n   plugins that haven't been approved by Shopify.\n * Some plugins and apps can get costly in the long run. Alongside the monthly\n   fee to Shopify, you may have to pay for a lot of the nifty tools that can\n   elevate your shopper experience.\n\nAbout Amazon FBA\nAmazon was founded in 1994 by Jeff Bezos. At first, it was an online bookstore,\nbut it soon expanded to include all sorts of products, a to z. Now, they're the\nlargest online retailer in the world and offer a wide range of services like\necommerce, cloud computing, and digital streaming. They’re also known for their\nexcellent customer service.\n\nHow does selling on Amazon work?\nWhen you set up your Amazon Seller account, you'll need to provide some basic\ninformation about your business, including your name, contact information, and\ntype of business.\n\nOnce you're approved as an Amazon seller, you'll be able to create listings for\nthe products you want to sell. You'll need to provide a title, product\ndescription, price, and shipping information. You can also upload product\nimages.\n\nWhen a customer buys one of your products, Amazon will notify you and ship the\nitem to the customer on your behalf. You'll need to pay Amazon a fee for each\nsale, as well as a monthly subscription fee.\n\nIf you're looking for an ecommerce platform that's easy to use and offers a wide\nrange of features, Amazon is a good option. However, there are a few things to\nkeep in mind before you start selling.\n\nAmazon FBA key features\n 1. Product research tools. Amazon provides a few different tools to help you\n    research which products are selling well and would be a good fit for your\n    business.\n 2. Automatic listing and repricing. Once you find a product that you want to\n    sell, you can list it on Amazon with just a few clicks. Amazon will also\n    automatically reprice your products based on competitor prices, so you don't\n    have to worry about manually changing your prices.\n 3. Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) program. Amazon offers fulfillment services to\n    help you with the logistics of shipping and customer service. When you use\n    FBA, Amazon will store your products in their warehouses and ship them to\n    customers when they make a purchase. You'll also have access to Amazon's\n    customer service team.\n\nAmazon Pricing\nWhen it comes to selling on Amazon, your costs will depend on your\n\n * Selling plan [https://sell.amazon.com/pricing#selling-plans] ($0.99/units\n   sold or $39.99 monthly)\n * Referral fees [https://sell.amazon.com/pricing#referral-fees] (8-15% for\n   using the Amazon brand to make sales)\n * Fulfillment fees [https://sell.amazon.com/pricing#fulfillment-fees]\n * Other costs [https://sell.amazon.com/pricing#other-costs] like long-term\n   storage.\n\nOf course, with all those recurring fees, Amazon will glady handle the product\ninsurance, care, delivery, customer service, and overall management. You just\nneed HD product photos and videos, strong descriptions, and good review\n[https://www.weblime.com/stories/how-to-add-reviews-on-shopify/]s.\n\nPros of selling on Amazon\n * A lot of traffic already. When you sell on Amazon, you're selling on a site\n   that already gets a ton of traffic. This means that there's a good chance\n   that your products will be seen by potential customers.\n * Familiar buying experience for customers. Customers are already familiar with\n   the Amazon buying experience, so they'll know what to expect when they\n   purchase from you.\n * Low marketing costs. Because Amazon is already so popular and trusted, you\n   won't have to spend as much on marketing and advertising to build that\n   credibility.\n * Super fast delivery. Unlike Shopify where your suppliers will likely use\n   third-party delivery teams that could take anywhere between a week to month,\n   FBA allows every product on your shelf to be delivered with same-day,\n   one-day, or two-day shipping. Some metropolitan areas in the U.S. may even\n   allow two hours!\n * Unparalleled customer service. Amazon is known for its excellent customer\n   service, so you can rest assured that your buyers will be taken care of if\n   they have any questions or problems, without any extra involvment from you.\n\nCons of selling on Amazon\n * You'll need to pay fees. Unlike Shopify, which has a monthly subscription\n   fee, Amazon charges sellers a per-sale fee as well as a monthly subscription\n   fee.\n * You may need to invest in additional tools. While Amazon does provide some\n   tools for sellers, you may need to invest in additional software to help you\n   manage your inventory and shipping.\n * There's a lot of competition. Because Amazon is such a popular platform,\n   there's a lot of competition among sellers. This means that you'll need to\n   work hard to make your listings stand out.\n * Lack of control over storytelling and branding. On Amazon, your product\n   listings will look very similar to everyone else's. For the most part, you're\n   using pre-built formatting and design, so it can be difficult to tell your\n   brand's story and build a strong connection with customers.\n\nThe verdict: Shopify or Amazon?\nSo, which eCommerce platform is right for you? As you can see, it really depends\non your needs and preferences. If you're looking for a trustworthy marketplace\nto sell your goods with a more \"hands-off\" approach, Amazon is a good option.\nHowever, if you want more control (CEO vibes) over your branding and\nstorytelling, Shopify may be a better fit.\n\nNo matter which platform you choose, the most important thing is to start\nbuilding your eCommerce business today. While it can be difficult navigating\neither platform, it doesn't have to be with Weblime's in-house designers and\ncopywriters who are at-the-ready to deliver your message attractively and\ncompellingly.\n\nNeed help building your eCommerce store?

Determine which platform is best for you and create a photography blog today!","slug":"photography-blog-platforms","plaintext":"If you’re ready to grow your photography business, it’s time for you to take the\ngiant leap and create a website. It can be a scary step, but it will feel more\nlike a comfortable step into the future if you have the right tools, like the\nright blogging platform.\n\nYou might not know how important it is to choose the right blogging platform for\nyour photography business. The truth is—when you publish photos on different\nplatforms like Instagram or Facebook, only a tiny percentage of viewers actually\nsee them. And when viewers do see them, they’re often fed more, so it’s hard for\nthem to keep up with everything you’ve done, which leaves them feeling\ndisconnected from your work.\n\nA blog is different from these other platforms because it is all about building\nan online presence on your website. Your blog\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog] will be constantly updated with new content\nto help your audience connect with what you have to share. The most successful\nbloggers post anywhere from 2-5 times a week and repost their previous posts to\nkeep their content fresh and easily accessible. No matter how many times you\nrepost, if you choose the right platform for bloggers, people will always be\nable to find new content to maintain a connection and feel like they’re part of\nsomething.\n\nBenefits of a photography blog\nThe benefits of creating a blog for your photography business are infinite. We\ncan think of a few things as exciting as having a blog to share your photos,\nexpress yourself, and let the world know what you do.\n\nBlogging is often one of the biggest factors in the success of photographers.\nHere are just a few of the many reasons why you should start blogging:\n\n * Showcase your work and build an online portfolio. One of the best ways to get\n   noticed is to have your work seen by as many people as possible—and with a\n   blog, you can easily do that.\n * Build your brand and gain exposure. Blogging is a great way to increase\n   traffic to your website, grow your social media following, and improve SEO\n   for your website or business.\n * Connect with like-minded people and build a community. Building relationships\n   within the photography community is one of the best ways to stay inspired,\n   grow as an artist, improve your photography skills and knowledge, find\n   clients, and generally enjoy being part of a supportive network where you can\n   share ideas.\n * Share your knowledge and expertise. As well as helping you connect with other\n   photographers, you can use blogging as a platform for sharing what you know\n   about photography with others—and when they see how much value they're\n   getting from reading what you write, they'll be more likely to want to come\n   back for more!\n\nBest blogging platforms for photographers\nWordPress is the most popular blogging platform for photographers. It offers a\nhigh degree of flexibility, including the ability to customize your site's\ndesign, add plugins, and integrate an online store. Tumblr isn't a traditional\nblogging platform, but it's another good option for photography blogs. The\nservice lets you create a photography blog easily, sharing just one shot or\nseveral in each post.\n\nGhost is another platform that promises photographers \"the best publishing tools\non the planet,\" according to its website. Ghost has a sleek interface and makes\nit easy to share links, videos, and photos in posts. You can even choose from\nmore than 100 themes to match your photography blog's style and personality.\n\nOn the other hand, Wix is one of the most accessible options for building a\nphotography blog without coding skills. Squarespace is another user-friendly\nsite builder that offers plenty of templates explicitly designed with\nphotographers in mind (including special features like slideshows).\n\nWordPress\nWordPress is the oldest and most widely used blogging platform. It boasts a huge\ndeveloper community that has created over 50,000 plugins and thousands of\nthemes. Because WordPress is open-source, you don’t have to pay for the platform\nitself or most plugins and themes.

In its free starter plan, you also get\n   unlimited storage space, which is ideal for photographers with large files\n   that take up more storage space than text-heavy sites. However, it doesn’t\n   offer a free custom domain name; instead, it provides a subdomain\n   (yourblog.wordpress.com).\n * WordPress.org—WordPress's self-hosted version allows you to host your blog on\n   your server so you can customize anything without worrying about someone\n   shutting down your blog.\n\nCheck out our WordPress guide\n[https://www.weblime.com/stories/the-ultimate-wordpress-guide] if you decide to\ngo in this route.\n\nGhost\nGhost is a blogging platform that has taken the world by storm.

Moreover,\nthe photographer’s portfolio could live on different platforms, making it hard\nto decide which link to send to a potential client.\n\nThe problem with this solution is that there is no way for clients to easily get\na sense of what kind of work the photographer does and how they could\npotentially help them.\n\nThat's why we created Limey [https://limey.io/]. Limey is a landing page builder\nthat helps photographers easily create digital business cards for their relevant\nportfolios (e.g., Shutterstock, Behance).

Clients will be able to\nvisit these pages and immediately get an idea of what kind of services or\nproducts a specific photographer offers.\n\nPick the right blogging platform to save time, energy, and effort so that you\ncan focus on what's important.\nOne of the most important decisions you’ll make as a blogger is choosing a\nblogging platform. The right blogging platform for your needs can help you save\ntime, energy, and effort to focus on what’s important – putting your best foot\nforward.\n\nThe following are some of the criteria we recommend thinking about when choosing\nyour photography blog platform:\n\n * Ease of use – an easy to use interface will save you time and money. You\n   won’t have to spend hours learning how to use it or fork over big bucks for\n   someone else to do it for you. Some popular platforms may seem easy at first\n   glance, but they can become complicated if customization is needed once you\n   dig deeper.\n * Features – Is there room to grow? Can the platform evolve with your changing\n   needs? Does it allow plugins or themes that will help expand its\n   capabilities? Will it provide everything you need now and in the future?\n * Branding – Does the platform allow complete control over your content and\n   branding? If branding matters to you, then choose carefully. Some platforms\n   add watermarks and links back to themselves and control what content goes on\n   your site. Avoid these unless this is acceptable to you.\n\nYou now have a pretty good idea of what you should be looking for in a\nphotography blog platform.\n\nThe most important thing to remember is that the perfect platform doesn't exist.\nYou need to pick one that will allow you to focus on what's really important:\nyour photography.","excerpt":"We reviewed the top photography blog platforms on the market.

This post covers 35 construction marketing ideas to consider when looking to grow your business.","slug":"construction-marketing-ideas","plaintext":"Construction companies looking to expand their business need to invest in a\nstrong marketing base. Marketing is essential for brand awareness and can be\nused as a powerful tool for acquiring new customers. For this reason, small\nbusinesses must invest in marketing to increase sales volume and remain relevant\nin the market.\n\nMarketing trends in the construction industry have seen builders adopt strategic\nmarketing approaches to overcome these challenges and increase profits.\nMarketing your business effectively requires you to use innovative strategies to\nmake it stand out from the rest. It is also essential to keep up with the latest\ntrends in advertising and promotion for best results.\n\nHere are 35 construction marketing\n[https://www.weblime.com/stories/construction-marketing/] ideas that will\ndominate the construction industry this year:\n\nConduct a marketing audit\nThe delivery of construction projects on time, within budget, and the required\nquality is your number one priority as a construction business owner. But, if\nyou do not have any marketing strategy in place, the chances are that your\nconstruction business will not survive for long.\n\nA marketing audit is a comprehensive assessment of your marketing resources,\nprocesses, and activities. It helps you identify where you’re coming short and\nwhat needs to be done to improve sales and profitability.\n\nBuild a custom website\nWhether you are a small contractor or a large contracting firm, having a website\nis a great way to market your business, reach out to new clients, and increase\nyour customer base.\n\nA website will help build trust with your potential customers and showcase your\nwork to the world. It will also allow you to keep track of what your competitors\nare up to and keep up with industry trends which will help you stay ahead of the\ngame.\n\nMake sure your website is mobile-friendly\n70% of web traffic comes from mobile phones\n[https://review42.com/resources/mobile-marketing-statistics/]. We live in the\nage of smartphones - anyone and anything is only a few clicks away. When\ncustomers decide who to hire, they are likely to do their research on a mobile\ndevice. If your website isn't mobile-friendly, you may be missing out on new\nbusiness.\n\nYou can't afford to ignore this opportunity, so make sure that your website is\neasily accessible on mobile devices.\n\nOptimize for conversions\nEveryone wants a website that is beautiful, usable, and converts (whether it's\nleads, sales, or whatever your goal is). But most people forget about one of the\nmost important parts of their site - the call to action.\n\nIt sounds simple, but you'd be surprised how many websites don't have a good\ncall to action. They have a nice website full of pretty images, but if it\ngenerates zero conversions, all those pretty images won't matter. If your goal\nis for people to contact you, it's not enough to just have a contact page or\nform on your site; you have to tell them what to do with it and why they should\nreach out.\n\nStart ABM (account-based marketing)\nAccount-based marketing helps you target and engage the right audience and\nconvert them into clients.\n\nHere are the significant benefits of ABM:\n\n * It’s personalized and targeted, so it delivers higher conversion rates;\n * It’s faster than traditional marketing methods;\n * It’s more efficient as it saves you both time and money;\n * You can measure and track your performance metrics;\n * Your team can work in unison as they have a common goal;\n * You get better returns on investment (ROI) as your efforts are focused and\n   not scattered.\n\nChoose a niche\nA niche market is a group of people interested in a specific aspect of your\nbusiness. A small homebuilder, for example, may choose to focus on building\nluxury homes. Homebuilders then find out where potential customers in the niche\nmarket live, the media they read, and the trade shows they attend and set up\nbooths at these locations.\n\nMarketing your company to a niche market requires extensive research. For\nexample, if you want to build luxury homes, you should research what makes a\nhome luxurious. Is it: Use of special materials like granite? The number of\nrooms? Expensive flooring? Large kitchen with top-of-the-line appliances? A wine\ncellar?\n\nOnce you have determined what buyers in the niche market want, create a\nmarketing plan that targets this group.\n\nCreate a blog\nIf you’re a construction company and you blog about the most efficient way to\nbuild a house, or some new technology in the industry, your audience will know\nthat you are keeping up with the latest trends in your field.\n\nBut beyond that, your blog tells people what you think is important. Your posts\nspeak volumes about your values and opinions. If you’re writing engaging\ncontent, people will be reading what you have to say, and they will begin to\ntrust your opinion. This can help you attract new clients who share similar\nperspectives to yours.\n\nLeverage SEO (search engine optimization)\nSEO helps you get found, and it's essential to make sure people can find your\nbusiness online.\n\nTo illustrate, let's assume that two construction companies each have an\nexcellent website with all their information clearly displayed, including their\nphone number and email address. One company has invested time and money into\ngood SEO, while the other hasn't bothered at all. Which one is going to get\nfound first?\n\nThe higher up on the SERP (search engine results pages) you rank, the more\nvisible you are to potential customers.\n\nSet up Google alerts\nThe first step in getting your content to rank high on the search engines is to\nknow what your customers are searching for.\n\nAnd you can find out exactly what they’re searching for with Google Alerts,\nwhich allows you to monitor the web for interesting new content that has been\npublished online.\n\nJust set up a list of keywords related to your construction business, and Google\nwill send you an email every time something new shows up online associated with\nthose keywords. That way, you can always be on top of what people are talking\nabout related to your industry.\n\nOptimize for local search\nIf you have a construction company that has a physical location, or even one\nthat doesn't but serves a local market, then local SEO is for you.\n\nLocal SEO can help your site show up in relevant search results when customers\ntype in location-specific keywords on sites like Google and Bing. For example,\nif someone searches \"construction companies near me,\" Google will display their\nbusinesses in the geographic area they specify.\n\nGet listed in directories and databases\nMake sure your business is listed in the most popular search engines and\ndirectories, including Google, Bing, and Yahoo!, along with other niche\ndirectories specific to your industry.\n\nThis increases your chances of being seen by potential customers when they're\nsearching online.\n\nAcquire more reviews\nThe key to getting more reviews is to have your customers tell you their honest\nopinion about your company. This may be difficult to do at first, but it is\nessential to establishing trust within the community.\n\nA well-written review can attract new clients while keeping existing ones happy\nwith their service or product.\n\nYou need both positive and negative feedback to grow as a business; otherwise,\nhow will you ever know what needs improvement?\n\nStart getting backlinks\nBacklinks are essentially links from other websites that point to yours.\n\nIf another website links to yours, web users must find value in your site.\nConsequently, search engines place more value on websites with a good number of\nquality backlinks. In simple terms, your content becomes more credible when\nother websites link to it.\n\nUse multichannel marketing\nMarketing channels are all about connecting with people.\n\nAs a construction company, you shouldn't rely on one channel only. The more\noptions you choose, the more chances you have to meet new customers.\n\nBe present on social media\nSocial media for construction companies is an important marketing tool that can\nenhance your online presence and drive business growth. By having an online\npresence on social media, you can connect with your target audience, show your\nexpertise in the industry, share relevant content and engage with your\ncustomers.\n\nThis is especially true for high-end projects, where homeowners invest thousands\nof dollars in major home renovations or new construction projects. Homeowners\nwant to make sure they hire a construction company with a good work ethic, does\nquality work, has fair prices, and, most importantly, is trustworthy.\n\nRun direct mail campaigns\nWhen was the last time you received a letter? A handwritten invitation to your\nfriend's wedding, or a card from grandma? Nowadays, it's rare to receive a\nletter in the mail.\n\nAnd that's what makes direct mail so effective. It breaks the clutter of digital\nmedia, gets your brand noticed, and is the perfect match for something as\ntangible as construction and architecture.\n\nUse videos to leverage your skills\nOne of the best ways to promote your business is through video. It can help you\ngenerate fresh leads, build your brand image and even increase sales. However,\nmany small business owners think that video marketing is expensive and takes too\nmuch time. This is why only a few companies use video marketing to promote their\nproducts or services.\n\nBut, you don’t need to spend thousands of dollars on a professional videographer\nor hire an agency to create videos for you. Most smartphones are capable of\nshooting high-quality videos. Therefore, you can get started with video\nmarketing with just your smartphone and a few basic tools.\n\nParticipate in expos\nShowcasing your work at an exhibition or event will help you reach the target\naudience faster.\n\nBut it is essential to choose the right kind of event for your target audience.\nIf you are looking for potential investors, a property investor summit would be\nmore suitable than a home buyer fair.\n\nA luxury housing summit would be ideal if you work in the luxury segment.\n\nOffer free estimates\nConstruction companies should offer free estimates to their potential buyers.\nFree estimates are a great way for customers to get an idea of their home\nrenovation project's total cost and to make side-by-side comparisons of\ndifferent contractors.\n\nTrack your phone calls\nCall tracking is a technology that tracks the calls generated from website\nvisitors through click-to-call buttons or call extensions in Google Ads. You can\nuse call tracking to see which marketing channels generate the most calls and\nhow many calls you receive from each channel.\n\nMost importantly, call tracking can help you run A/B tests on ad copy, landing\npages, online forms, etc., to improve your calls-to-action to get more phone\nleads.\n\nUse SMS marketing\nText messages are one of the most convenient ways to get in touch with people.\n\nOne way to build your messaging list is through a signup form on your website.\nYou can also request your customers and clients to opt-in while doing business\nwith you.\n\nCreate referral programs\nThe best way to cultivate relationships is through referral marketing software\nwhich allows you to identify loyal customers and incentivize these users to\nrefer other people to your products.\n\nFor instance, you can reward points for every construction project booked. In\nthis case, the more projects booked, the higher the customer's membership level\nbecomes. Then you can offer special benefits such as free upgrades or priority\nservice when they reach certain tiers in the program.\n\nUse flyers\nPrinted marketing materials aren't dead.\n\nSend your materials to relevant local businesses in your area. For example,\nconsider sending your brochure to local cafes or restaurants if you're doing\nlandscaping or gardening services. Not only will it give you exposure - if the\nrestaurant has a lovely patio for outdoor dining, then your brochure is more\nlikely to get attention from their customers!\n\nCreate an online portfolio\nInstagram and Pinterest are two platforms that are very visual and will help you\ngain more exposure.\n\nPost pictures of previous construction projects you've undertaken. Use relevant\nhashtags when uploading your photos so other users can find them when searching\nfor specific topics.\n\nFocus on retaining your customers\nHere are seven ways you can create a customer retention program for your\nconstruction business:\n\n * Don't be afraid to ask for feedback.\n * Make it easy for clients to contact you.\n * Thank clients for working with you.\n * Celebrate milestones and anniversaries with your clients.\n * Send out cards on holidays and birthdays.\n * Just check in and don’t try to sell anything.\n\nJoin LinkedIn groups for construction professionals\nConsider joining LinkedIn groups to connect with others in your industry, share\nknowledge and insights, and build buzz for yourself and your company.\n\nJoin Facebook groups for homeowners\nThese are the kinds of people already planning a renovation, but they may not be\nready to call your company yet. By being part of their community, you get to\nknow them better and share information about home improvements and remodeling\nprojects.\n\nThis is a great way to get in front of your audience and start building\nrelationships with them before they've decided to hire you.\n\nHost a webinar\nThe construction industry has many topics that could be explored in a webinar\nseries.\n\nIt's a great way to engage with potential customers in a very personal manner.\nBy hosting this type of event, you can share your knowledge with others who may\nnot be familiar with your industry.\n\nConsider donating\nIf you work in the trades and have leftover building materials, donating them is\na good way to get backlinks. As much as 30% of all building materials\n[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123814753100154] \ndelivered to a typical construction site can end up as waste.\n\nNot only will you make it easier for someone else, who is not so fortunate as\nyourself, but you'll also be doing something good for the environment while\ngetting some PR mileage out of it.\n\nNetwork with business owners\nNetworking can be done in person or online. In-person networking includes\nattending conferences, workshops, seminars, industry meetings, trade shows, and\nother events that bring together people in your industry.\n\nOnline networking includes connecting with people on social media sites, such as\nLinkedIn or Facebook, joining professional groups on these sites, joining online\ndiscussion forums in your field, and following industry leaders on Twitter to\nkeep up with their latest news and insights.\n\nLeverage testimonials\nThere are a few different ways to get reviews:\n\n 1. You can ask for them directly. Just like you would ask for a testimonial or\n    a case study, ask someone enjoying your product or service if they would be\n    willing to leave a review for you.\n 2. Ask for them indirectly. In other words, when someone does share feedback\n    with you, ask them politely if they would mind leaving that same feedback on\n    one of the various platforms that allow reviews.\n 3. Make it easy for your customers and clients to leave reviews with direct\n    links to the most popular review sites (Google, Amazon, Yelp, etc.). This is\n    an excellent idea if you have an online store where people purchase products\n    directly from you.\n 4. Don't worry about negative reviews—just keep focusing on doing what's right\n    for your customers and clients, and those positive reviews will follow!\n\nUse a CRM\nConstruction companies can use information from a CRM system to market their\nproducts and services to target customers.\n\nFor example, a company that builds new houses can use information from its CRM\nsystem to market its services to customers who are buying a house for the first\ntime.\n\nWork orders, customer preferences, and other data collected in the CRM system\ncan be used to create targeted marketing campaigns that will likely appeal to\ncustomers looking for specific construction services.\n\nUse Google Analytics\nGoogle Analytics is an excellent tool for tracking not only who comes to your\nwebsite but also where they come from, what they do once they're there, and how\nlong they stay.\n\nHere’s why you should use it:\n\n * It's free!\n * You can track almost anything you want (or need)\n * Analytics are easy to understand\n * Measure your website's social media impact\n * Catch 404s and other broken links\n * Lots of third-party support available\n * You can see what people click on when they're on your site\n\nSet up paid ads on Google or Facebook\nThe pay-per-click (PPC) model helps businesses spend only on the ads that\nreceive clicks from potential customers without any extra charges for displaying\nads. This model allows companies to save money compared to traditional\nadvertising methods such as TV commercials and newspaper advertising.\n\nYou can choose to set up ads on any social media platform, but you should focus\nmainly on Google or Facebook as a construction company.\n\nConsider expanding\nThe US construction industry is highly fragmented, with many small companies and\na handful of large firms. This makes it difficult to decide where to expand,\nespecially since the high unemployment rate has hit the construction industry.\n\nCheck out some workforce statistics [https://www.bls.gov/iag/tgs/iag23.htm] and\nanalyze which states have seen an increase in recent years. The best place to\nexpand would be a state that has recently seen an increase in its construction\nindustry, as indicated by an increase in its percentage of employment in\nconstruction.\n\nConclusion\nIt's no secret that proper marketing can grow your construction company\nsignificantly.\n\nThe best way to implement these 35 ideas is by planning a marketing campaign and\nworking on the goals more systematically.\n\nWhile doing so, you need to consider important metrics like cost per leads,\nconversion rates and overall efficiency. If your campaign is successful and\nleads are generated, you should be getting a good return on investment.\n\nThe options above give you plenty of good places to start!","excerpt":"Build a Facebook or host a webinar.
