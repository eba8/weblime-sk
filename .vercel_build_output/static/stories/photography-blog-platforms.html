  <div class="prose-primary prose relative mx-auto mt-8 px-5 pb-10 md:prose-lg md:px-0 lg:prose-xl"><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><p>If you’re ready to grow your photography business, it’s time for you to take the giant leap and create a website. It can be a scary step, but it will feel more like a comfortable step into the future if you have the right tools, like the right blogging platform.</p><p>You might not know how important it is to choose the right blogging platform for your photography business. The truth is—when you publish photos on different platforms like Instagram or Facebook, only a tiny percentage of viewers actually see them. And when viewers do see them, they’re often fed more, so it’s hard for them to keep up with everything you’ve done, which leaves them feeling disconnected from your work.</p><p>A <strong>blog</strong> is different from these other platforms because it is all about building an online presence on your website. Your <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog">blog</a> will be constantly updated with new content to help your audience connect with what you have to share. The most successful bloggers post anywhere from 2-5 times a week and repost their previous posts to keep their content fresh and easily accessible. No matter how many times you repost, if you choose the right <strong>platform for bloggers</strong>, people will always be able to find new content to maintain a connection and feel like they’re part of something.</p><h3 id="benefits-of-a-photography-blog">Benefits of a photography blog</h3><p>The benefits of creating a blog for your photography business are infinite. We can think of a few things as exciting as having a blog to share your photos, express yourself, and let the world know what you do.</p><p>Blogging is often one of the biggest factors in the success of photographers. Here are just a few of the many reasons why you should start blogging:</p><ul><li>Showcase your work and build an online portfolio. One of the best ways to get noticed is to have your work seen by as many people as possible—and with a blog, you can easily do that.</li><li>Build your brand and gain exposure. Blogging is a great way to <strong>increase traffic</strong> to your website, grow your social media following, and improve SEO for your website or business.</li><li>Connect with like-minded people and build a community. Building relationships within the photography community is one of the best ways to stay inspired, grow as an artist, improve your photography skills and knowledge, find clients, and generally enjoy being part of a supportive network where you can share ideas.</li><li>Share your knowledge and expertise. As well as helping you connect with other photographers, you can use blogging as a platform for sharing what you know about photography with others—and when they see how much value they're getting from reading what you write, they'll be more likely to want to come back for more!</li></ul><h3 id="best-blogging-platforms-for-photographers">Best blogging platforms for photographers</h3><p>WordPress is the most popular blogging platform for photographers. It offers a high degree of flexibility, including the ability to customize your site's design, add plugins, and integrate an online store. Tumblr isn't a traditional blogging platform, but it's another good option for photography blogs. The service lets you create a photography blog easily, sharing just one shot or several in each post.</p><p>Ghost is another platform that promises photographers "the best publishing tools on the planet," according to its website. Ghost has a sleek interface and makes it easy to share links, videos, and photos in posts. You can even choose from more than 100 themes to match your photography blog's style and personality.</p><p>On the other hand, Wix is one of the most accessible options for building a photography blog without coding skills. Squarespace is another user-friendly site builder that offers plenty of templates explicitly designed with photographers in mind (including special features like slideshows).</p><h3 id="wordpress">WordPress</h3><p>WordPress is the oldest and most widely used blogging platform. It boasts a huge developer community that has created over 50,000 plugins and thousands of themes. Because WordPress is open-source, you don’t have to pay for the platform itself or most plugins and themes. There are two versions of WordPress:</p><ul><li>WordPress.com—This version of WordPress gives you access to hundreds of free themes and thousands of free plugins. In its free starter plan, you also get unlimited storage space, which is ideal for photographers with large files that take up more storage space than text-heavy sites. However, it doesn’t offer a free custom domain name; instead, it provides a subdomain (yourblog.wordpress.com).</li><li>WordPress.org—WordPress's self-hosted version allows you to host your blog on your server so you can customize anything without worrying about someone shutting down your blog.</li></ul><p>Check out our <a href="https://www.weblime.com/stories/the-ultimate-wordpress-guide">WordPress guide</a> if you decide to go in this route.</p><h3 id="ghost">Ghost</h3><p>Ghost is a blogging platform that has taken the world by storm. It's been praised for its easy-to-use interface and customization options, allowing users to create their ideal website.</p><p>Ghost’s team also created a simple editor to write your stories and blog posts easily, as well as an author section where you can introduce yourself to visitors with your author bio.</p><p>Ghost has built-in SEO options and code injection capabilities, so it's always good to go for search engine ranking or quick compatibility fixes. You’ll also be able to publish your content directly on Facebook, Twitter, or other social media channels from Ghost’s dashboard.</p><p>Ghost is an excellent option for photographers if you're looking for an easy-to-use blogging platform focused on writing!</p><h3 id="wix">Wix</h3><p>The truth is, Wix is a powerful tool that allows you to build truly beautiful websites. The platform has many unique features, including <strong>templates</strong> perfect for photographers. You can create photo galleries with albums and photos easily customizable via drag and drop. You also have access to great editing tools, like lightbox and automatic image optimization. This makes creating high-quality sites a snap.</p><h3 id="squarespace">Squarespace</h3><p>Squarespace is a popular and easy-to-use website builder that offers several templates for photographers. If you’re not experienced with coding and want to put together a portfolio quickly, Squarespace is a great choice. The platform is extremely user-friendly, making it easy to add your images and set up your site in just hours. You can also take advantage of the support community or search through the help forums if you need extra assistance creating your photography website.</p><h3 id="limey">Limey</h3><p>When photographers do business with clients, they often have to send the client a portfolio, which is only accessible via the photographer's website. Moreover, the photographer’s portfolio could live on different platforms, making it hard to decide which link to send to a potential client.</p><p>The problem with this solution is that there is no way for clients to easily get a sense of what kind of work the photographer does and how they could potentially help them.</p><p>That's why we created <a href="https://limey.io/">Limey</a>. Limey is a landing page builder that helps photographers easily create digital business cards for their relevant portfolios (e.g., Shutterstock, Behance). Limey allows photographers to add links to their existing online portfolios and populate their landing pages with links to any websites they want to refer clients to. Clients will be able to visit these pages and immediately get an idea of what kind of services or products a specific photographer offers.</p><h3 id="pick-the-right-blogging-platform-to-save-time-energy-and-effort-so-that-you-can-focus-on-whats-important">Pick the right blogging platform to save time, energy, and effort so that you can focus on what's important.</h3><p>One of the most important decisions you’ll make as a blogger is choosing a blogging platform. The right blogging platform for your needs can help you save time, energy, and effort to focus on what’s important – putting your best foot forward.</p><p>The following are some of the criteria we recommend thinking about when choosing your <strong>photography blog</strong> platform:</p><ul><li>Ease of use – an easy to use interface will save you time and money. You won’t have to spend hours learning how to use it or fork over big bucks for someone else to do it for you. Some popular platforms may seem easy at first glance, but they can become complicated if customization is needed once you dig deeper.</li><li>Features – Is there room to grow? Can the platform evolve with your changing needs? Does it allow plugins or themes that will help expand its capabilities? Will it provide everything you need now and in the future?</li><li>Branding – Does the platform allow complete control over your content and branding? If branding matters to you, then choose carefully. Some platforms add watermarks and links back to themselves and control what content goes on your site. Avoid these unless this is acceptable to you.</li></ul><p>You now have a pretty good idea of what you should be looking for in a photography blog platform.</p><p>The most important thing to remember is that the perfect platform doesn't exist. You need to pick one that will allow you to focus on what's really important: your photography.</p><!-- HTML_TAG_END --></div>

It can be a scary step, but it will feel more like a comfortable step into the future if you have the right tools, like the right blogging platform.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>You might not know how important it is to choose the right blogging platform for your photography business. The truth is—when you publish photos on different platforms like Instagram or Facebook, only a tiny percentage of viewers actually see them. And when viewers do see them, they’re often fed more, so it’s hard for them to keep up with everything you’ve done, which leaves them feeling disconnected from your work.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>A \u003Cstrong>blog\u003C/strong> is different from these other platforms because it is all about building an online presence on your website. Your \u003Ca href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog\\\">blog\u003C/a> will be constantly updated with new content to help your audience connect with what you have to share. The most successful bloggers post anywhere from 2-5 times a week and repost their previous posts to keep their content fresh and easily accessible. No matter how many times you repost, if you choose the right \u003Cstrong>platform for bloggers\u003C/strong>, people will always be able to find new content to maintain a connection and feel like they’re part of something.\u003C/p>\u003Ch3 id=\\\"benefits-of-a-photography-blog\\\">Benefits of a photography blog\u003C/h3>\u003Cp>The benefits of creating a blog for your photography business are infinite. We can think of a few things as exciting as having a blog to share your photos, express yourself, and let the world know what you do.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Blogging is often one of the biggest factors in the success of photographers. Here are just a few of the many reasons why you should start blogging:\u003C/p>\u003Cul>\u003Cli>Showcase your work and build an online portfolio. One of the best ways to get noticed is to have your work seen by as many people as possible—and with a blog, you can easily do that.\u003C/li>\u003Cli>Build your brand and gain exposure. Blogging is a great way to \u003Cstrong>increase traffic\u003C/strong> to your website, grow your social media following, and improve SEO for your website or business.\u003C/li>\u003Cli>Connect with like-minded people and build a community. Building relationships within the photography community is one of the best ways to stay inspired, grow as an artist, improve your photography skills and knowledge, find clients, and generally enjoy being part of a supportive network where you can share ideas.\u003C/li>\u003Cli>Share your knowledge and expertise. As well as helping you connect with other photographers, you can use blogging as a platform for sharing what you know about photography with others—and when they see how much value they're getting from reading what you write, they'll be more likely to want to come back for more!\u003C/li>\u003C/ul>\u003Ch3 id=\\\"best-blogging-platforms-for-photographers\\\">Best blogging platforms for photographers\u003C/h3>\u003Cp>WordPress is the most popular blogging platform for photographers. It offers a high degree of flexibility, including the ability to customize your site's design, add plugins, and integrate an online store. Tumblr isn't a traditional blogging platform, but it's another good option for photography blogs. The service lets you create a photography blog easily, sharing just one shot or several in each post.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Ghost is another platform that promises photographers \\\"the best publishing tools on the planet,\\\" according to its website. Ghost has a sleek interface and makes it easy to share links, videos, and photos in posts. You can even choose from more than 100 themes to match your photography blog's style and personality.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>On the other hand, Wix is one of the most accessible options for building a photography blog without coding skills. Squarespace is another user-friendly site builder that offers plenty of templates explicitly designed with photographers in mind (including special features like slideshows).\u003C/p>\u003Ch3 id=\\\"wordpress\\\">WordPress\u003C/h3>\u003Cp>WordPress is the oldest and most widely used blogging platform. It boasts a huge developer community that has created over 50,000 plugins and thousands of themes. Because WordPress is open-source, you don’t have to pay for the platform itself or most plugins and themes. There are two versions of WordPress:\u003C/p>\u003Cul>\u003Cli>WordPress.com—This version of WordPress gives you access to hundreds of free themes and thousands of free plugins. In its free starter plan, you also get unlimited storage space, which is ideal for photographers with large files that take up more storage space than text-heavy sites. However, it doesn’t offer a free custom domain name; instead, it provides a subdomain (yourblog.wordpress.com).\u003C/li>\u003Cli>WordPress.org—WordPress's self-hosted version allows you to host your blog on your server so you can customize anything without worrying about someone shutting down your blog.\u003C/li>\u003C/ul>\u003Cp>Check out our \u003Ca href=\\\"https://www.weblime.com/stories/the-ultimate-wordpress-guide\\\">WordPress guide\u003C/a> if you decide to go in this route.\u003C/p>\u003Ch3 id=\\\"ghost\\\">Ghost\u003C/h3>\u003Cp>Ghost is a blogging platform that has taken the world by storm. It's been praised for its easy-to-use interface and customization options, allowing users to create their ideal website.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Ghost’s team also created a simple editor to write your stories and blog posts easily, as well as an author section where you can introduce yourself to visitors with your author bio.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Ghost has built-in SEO options and code injection capabilities, so it's always good to go for search engine ranking or quick compatibility fixes. You’ll also be able to publish your content directly on Facebook, Twitter, or other social media channels from Ghost’s dashboard.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Ghost is an excellent option for photographers if you're looking for an easy-to-use blogging platform focused on writing!\u003C/p>\u003Ch3 id=\\\"wix\\\">Wix\u003C/h3>\u003Cp>The truth is, Wix is a powerful tool that allows you to build truly beautiful websites. The platform has many unique features, including \u003Cstrong>templates\u003C/strong> perfect for photographers. You can create photo galleries with albums and photos easily customizable via drag and drop. You also have access to great editing tools, like lightbox and automatic image optimization. This makes creating high-quality sites a snap.\u003C/p>\u003Ch3 id=\\\"squarespace\\\">Squarespace\u003C/h3>\u003Cp>Squarespace is a popular and easy-to-use website builder that offers several templates for photographers. If you’re not experienced with coding and want to put together a portfolio quickly, Squarespace is a great choice. The platform is extremely user-friendly, making it easy to add your images and set up your site in just hours. You can also take advantage of the support community or search through the help forums if you need extra assistance creating your photography website.\u003C/p>\u003Ch3 id=\\\"limey\\\">Limey\u003C/h3>\u003Cp>When photographers do business with clients, they often have to send the client a portfolio, which is only accessible via the photographer's website. Moreover, the photographer’s portfolio could live on different platforms, making it hard to decide which link to send to a potential client.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>The problem with this solution is that there is no way for clients to easily get a sense of what kind of work the photographer does and how they could potentially help them.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>That's why we created \u003Ca href=\\\"https://limey.io/\\\">Limey\u003C/a>. Limey is a landing page builder that helps photographers easily create digital business cards for their relevant portfolios (e.g., Shutterstock, Behance). Limey allows photographers to add links to their existing online portfolios and populate their landing pages with links to any websites they want to refer clients to. Clients will be able to visit these pages and immediately get an idea of what kind of services or products a specific photographer offers.\u003C/p>\u003Ch3 id=\\\"pick-the-right-blogging-platform-to-save-time-energy-and-effort-so-that-you-can-focus-on-whats-important\\\">Pick the right blogging platform to save time, energy, and effort so that you can focus on what's important.\u003C/h3>\u003Cp>One of the most important decisions you’ll make as a blogger is choosing a blogging platform. The right blogging platform for your needs can help you save time, energy, and effort to focus on what’s important – putting your best foot forward.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>The following are some of the criteria we recommend thinking about when choosing your \u003Cstrong>photography blog\u003C/strong> platform:\u003C/p>\u003Cul>\u003Cli>Ease of use – an easy to use interface will save you time and money. You won’t have to spend hours learning how to use it or fork over big bucks for someone else to do it for you. Some popular platforms may seem easy at first glance, but they can become complicated if customization is needed once you dig deeper.\u003C/li>\u003Cli>Features – Is there room to grow? Can the platform evolve with your changing needs? Does it allow plugins or themes that will help expand its capabilities? Will it provide everything you need now and in the future?\u003C/li>\u003Cli>Branding – Does the platform allow complete control over your content and branding? If branding matters to you, then choose carefully. Some platforms add watermarks and links back to themselves and control what content goes on your site. Avoid these unless this is acceptable to you.\u003C/li>\u003C/ul>\u003Cp>You now have a pretty good idea of what you should be looking for in a photography blog platform.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>The most important thing to remember is that the perfect platform doesn't exist. You need to pick one that will allow you to focus on what's really important: your photography.\u003C/p>\",\"comment_id\":\"6278322c3a67cc05e06f546e\",\"feature_image\":\"https://blog.weblime.com/content/images/2022/05/Photography-blog-platforms-icons.png\",\"featured\":false,\"visibility\":\"public\",\"email_recipient_filter\":\"all\",\"created_at\":\"2022-05-08T17:12:12.000-04:00\",\"updated_at\":\"2022-05-11T16:16:51.000-04:00\",\"published_at\":\"2022-05-08T17:23:14.000-04:00\",\"custom_excerpt\":\"We reviewed the top photography blog platforms on the market.
