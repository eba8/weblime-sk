This includes following up with leads, sending e-mails, and collecting information.</p><p>Automating your eCommerce marketing can help you free up time by creating and launching campaigns. The days when you had to hire people for mundane tasks are long gone. Developers and companies have created software that will remove the blood, sweat, and tears from repetitive tasks so you can focus on other aspects of your business.</p><h3 id=\"what-does-ecommerce-marketing-automation-include\">What does eCommerce marketing automation include?</h3><p>Automation takes care of <strong>marketing</strong> and <strong>sales engagement</strong> while driving <a href=\"https://www.weblime.com/stories/ecommerce-dashboard\">measurable results</a>. It allows you to easily design, execute, and automate your campaigns or tasks across multiple departments. You can simultaneously scale up your marketing efforts while achieving a consistent customer experience.</p><p>Automation software comes in many different forms. Some simplify workflows, while others tackle analysis. Let's take a closer look at four of the most valuable types of automation software.</p><p><strong>Marketing Automation Software</strong></p><p>Marketing automation software is all about simplifying and streamlining your marketing processes. For example, you can use it to automate repetitive tasks like email campaigns. Marketing <a href=\"https://www.weblime.com/stories/shopify-automation\">automation tools</a> also help track and analyze marketing and sales data to easily get a big picture view of all your marketing endeavors.</p><p><strong>Workflow automation</strong></p><p>High-volume retailers often use workflow automation tools to ensure their orders are processed efficiently. Workflow automation software can automatically update systems when orders are shipped or returned, track inventory, and make sure customers are billed correctly. Some workflow automation tools can also make recommendations based on past performance and projected demand.</p><p><strong>Customer Relationship Management (CRM) Software</strong></p><p>CRM software deals with customer interactions on an individual level. This is where you'll find information about customers' details, contact information, and order histories. It also allows you to send personalized emails, messages, and promotions to specific customers based on their actions or data. Because of this, CRM helps improve customer relations significantly by assisting companies in sending the right message to the right person at the right time.</p><p><strong>Web Analytics Software</strong></p><p>Web Analytics is where you find data about how visitors interact with your website or online store. Tracking metrics like bounce rate, page views per visit, and time on site are essential for understanding which pages are working best and which ones need improvement. With data from web analytics software, you can calculate how well your campaigns are performing and how good your website’s UI/UX is.</p><h3 id=\"best-ecommerce-automation-tools\">Best eCommerce Automation Tools</h3><p>Now that you know the main categories of eCommerce marketing automation its time to have a closer look at some of the best tools out there.</p><p><strong>Email Marketing Automation Tools</strong></p><p>To recap, email marketing automation is a way to deliver emails to customers based on their behaviors. You can also segment users based on demographics, such as age, location, or behavior.</p><p>Some examples of email marketing automation include:</p><p><strong>Abandoned Cart Emails</strong></p><p>Many users tend to add a product to their carts and never really finish the checkout process. They might want to save their cart for later, but they simply forget about it in most cases.</p><p>Instead of losing these customers, you can set up an abandoned cart email campaign that will automatically send out a message reminding users about the products they never really purchased. This can help you increase sales for an extremely low cost, and it’s all automatic.</p><p><strong>Cross-sell and Upsell Emails</strong></p><p>After users purchase a product from your store, they will most likely receive a confirmation email. This is usually autogenerated by the <strong>eCommerce platform</strong> you are using. But after they get this initial email, most people never hear back from the store they just purchased from.</p><p>A cross-sell or upsell email campaign automatically sends out a message to your previous customers so they can come back and buy again. When you set up such a campaign, you want to make sure that you also include an incentive (like a discount coupon) so people will be more likely to reorder from your store.</p><p>Remember, previous customers are more likely to purchase from you than new users. This happens because they already trust your business and know that there is nothing to worry about.</p><p><strong>Customer Engagement Emails</strong></p><p>If your store allows users to create an account, you should have a bunch of useful information about them. Customer engagement emails are a great way to strengthen the relationship between your business and users by sending them a “Happy Birthday” message with a special discount.</p><p>Building this relationship will turn customers into brand advocates who will recommend your store to their friends and family.</p><p><strong>Promotional Emails</strong></p><p>Say you have ordered a large quantity of a specific product because your supplier had a great offer. You now decide to run a campaign and apply a discount to that particular product or category.</p><p>The best and cheapest way to boost your sales is to set up a promotional email campaign and let everyone on your list know about your offer.</p><p>On the other hand, if your stock runs low on a product and you want to get rid of it to buy its new variant, you can send out a message to your list letting them know about it.</p><h4 id=\"klaviyomost-accessible-email-marketing-automation-tool\"><strong><a href=\"https://www.klaviyo.com/\">Klaviyo</a> - most accessible email marketing automation tool</strong></h4><p>Klaviyo helps e‑commerce businesses collect, analyze and use customer data to optimize marketing strategies and maximize revenue.

For example, maybe you want every new customer in <strong>Shopify</strong> to be <strong>automatically</strong> added as a subscriber in MailChimp. You'd create a Zap—or an automated workflow—that watches for new customers in Shopify and adds those people to your MailChimp list. Whenever someone places an order in your Shopify store from then on, Zapier will add them to your MailChimp list automatically.</p><p>Zapier works by watching for triggers in the app where your data starts (for example, a new sale in Shopify), then it automatically performs actions in the app where you want to use that data (like adding the sale as a new row in Excel).</p><p>If you don’t use Shopify, you have nothing to worry about.

If you're one of the many\nWordPress users out there who has a website made with WordPress and a HubSpot\naccount, you can use this handy plugin to help you add more data about your\nvisitors and follow up with them via email.\n\nHubSpot provides a plugin that allows you to integrate your HubSpot account with\nyour WordPress site, so customers can enter their details directly into your\nwebsite form, entering them into the lead nurturing and tracking funnel.\n\nThis is what HubSpot can help you with:\n\n * Easily add forms to your website: The HubSpot Marketing Plugin makes it\n   simple to create, customize, and embed your own forms on posts and pages.\n   Their drag-and-drop form builder allows you to tailor forms for any marketing\n   need.\n * Personalize the visitor experience: You can personalize every visitor's\n   experience by using information from their contact records.

Analyze trends across pages and posts,\n   see which pages are most engaging, view referral traffic sources, and see\n   which content generates the most leads within WordPress.\n\nUsing the Site Kit plugin for WordPress\nFinally, a way to get the most out of your WordPress site without having to dig\nthrough data and charts or spend hours poring over spreadsheets.\n\nSite Kit is an official plugin from Google that lets you access data from\nmultiple sources (such as Google Analytics or Google Ads) directly from your\nWordPress dashboard.\n\nWith this plugin, you'll be able to:\n\n * View your stats directly on your WordPress dashboard and make decisions based\n   on that data;\n * View stats from multiple Google tools such as Google Analytics or Google\n   Search Console;\n * Set up various Google tools without touching a single line of code;\n * Track your desired KPIs for the entire website or specific pages only.\n\nSite Kit supports the following tools:\n\n 1.

In this scenario, you might send them a welcome message\nimmediately but then wait two days before sending another email with a\nhyper-specific sales pitch.\n\nThere are lots of ways you can use drip emails in your business. You could use\nthem to remind customers that their credit card is about to expire or to notify\nthem that their domain name will expire soon.

They also have some great other\nintegrations, like conversion tracking, full Google Analytics integration, and\nmore.\n\nGravity Forms Plugin for WordPress\nGravity Forms is the plugin you should use to create your forms, and while it\nisn't free (you can purchase a single-site license for $59 per year), Gravity\nForms is one of the most popular form builders, with good reason.

But is that really necessary? If there are\nplenty of other tools available to help your site with marketing automation, why\nnot just use them?\n\nIn case you hadn't realized it yet: WordPress isn’t very beginner-friendly when\nit comes to marketing automation unless you are strategic about which plugins\nyou choose to use. There's no built-in way to update your posts or schedule\npages for email outreach automatically; for example, you have to do everything\nyourself manually. And when it comes to lead generation and sales funnels made\nup of multiple steps, WordPress is hardly the most efficient tool around.\n\nIt's also essential to keep a healthy WordPress installation while working on\nautomation. It's easy to keep adding plugins and features and find yourself with\na bloated setup.

And part of that means choosing the right platform to set up shop.\nNaturally, your decision comes down to the two industry titans: Amazon vs\nShopify.\n\nWhile both eCommerce platforms allow third-party vendors to sell their products,\nShopify and Amazon have some important distinctions that you need to consider\nbefore launching your own eCommerce business.\n\nAt Weblime [https://www.weblime.com/], we're going to cover everything you need\nto know about both with in-depth reviews so you can decide which ecommerce\nplatform is best for you.\n\nShopify vs Amazon: Key differences\n * While Shopify is a specialized ecommerce platform, Amazon is more of an\n   online marketplace. On Shopify, you can build your own standalone online\n   store from the ground up. But on Amazon, you're selling products on the\n   Amazon marketplace, where millions of people shop already, alongside other\n   third-party sellers. So while you need to build an audience for your Shopify\n   store (a private entity), you're tapping into an audience with Amazon FBA (a\n   public marketplace).\n * Shopify is brand-centric, Amazon is Amazon-centric. On Shopify, you're\n   building your own brand – a separate entity. That means investing in\n   long-term digital marketing\n   [https://www.weblime.com/stories/ultimate-guide-to-digital-marketing/] \n   efforts on social media, search engines (SEO\n   [https://www.embarque.io/post/global-seo]), and handling public relations.\n   Customer service is also your responsibility and reflects on your brand\n   image. But with Amazon, merchants give up most of the spotlight (branding,\n   custom design, customer support) while they collect sales revenue behind the\n   curtain.\n * Shopify is more hands-on (lower costs), Amazon is more hands-off (higher\n   costs). To build and operate your own online store using Shopify's ecommerce\n   tools, \n   [https://www.shopify.ca/pricing?term=shopify%20plans&adid=565729915161&campaignid=15436644442&branded_enterprise=1&BOID=brand&gclid=CjwKCAjwsJ6TBhAIEiwAfl4TWMnOHbcP09pf9RwKyAZPOjoJAc-38rmjIUOemp-avZ_mqcrythFKrhoCiqYQAvD_BwE&cmadid=516586854;cmadvertiserid=10730501;cmcampaignid=26990768;cmplacementid=324494812;cmcreativeid=163722649;cmsiteid=5500011]\n   monthly subscriptions are available for different sized businesses. You'll\n   need to find your own suppliers (through Aliexpress, Alibaba, or Zendrop,\n   etc.), monitor product delivery, and handle customer service issues. With\n   Amazon everything from product insurance, care, delivery, customer service,\n   and overall management is taken care of. You just have to supply product\n   media and copy, along with paying recurring costs like your selling plan,\n   referral fees, fulfillment fees , and other expenses like long-term storage.\n\nWhat is Shopify?\nShopify is a Canadian eCommerce company founded in 2006 by Tobias Lütke, Daniel\nWeinand, and Scott Lake. Their bread and butter is pretty straightforward: an\neCommerce platform for businesses of all sizes to create an online store. It's\nused by some of the world's largest brands, including Tesla, General Electric,\nBudweiser, Red Bull, and Nestle.\n\nShopify’s key features:\n 1. A customizable platform: Shopify offers users a customizable platform to\n    build their own online store. You can choose from a variety of Shopify\n    themes or hire a professional team\n    [https://www.weblime.com/stories/shopify-marketing-agency/] to add custom\n    code to personalize the look and feel you want for your online store. And\n    with the Shopify App store, you can add all sorts of nifty\n    conversion-boosting features and functionalities.\n 2. Wide range of integrations: Shopify's interface is designed to be\n    easy-to-use because 99% of applications don't need technical experience,\n    thanks to integrations. For example, with Google and Facebook, you can\n    easily set up your traffic and audience engagement trackers (pixels), which\n    normally involve coding knowledge. Other plugins can help you automate\n    repetitive processes [https://www.weblime.com/stories/shopify-automation/].\n 3. Integrated email marketing: With Shopify, you can send automated emails to\n    your customers based on their interactions with your store. For example, you\n    can set up an abandoned cart email campaign to recover lost sales, a\n    customer retention email series to keep your customers engaged, and\n    post-purchase emails to cross-sell or upsell products. All of these are\n    customizable and require no coding knowledge.\n 4. A built-in blog: Shopify has a built-in blogging feature that lets you\n    easily create content to drive traffic and engage your customers. You can\n    write blog posts, create product pages, and add other types of content to\n    your store. And with Shopify's SEO features, you can optimize your content\n    so that it ranks higher in search engines.\n 5. Shopify payments: With Shopify Payments, you can accept credit cards and\n    other forms of payment on your store without having to set up a third-party\n    payment processor. Shopify Payments is available in the US, Canada, UK,\n    Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, and Singapore.\n\nAlthough you can edit your store page and navigate rather intuitively on Amazon,\nit simply doesn't offer the same suite of store and brand-building tools because\nagain, Amazon isn't too focused on providing third-party merchants personal\nbranding power.\n\nShopify Pricing\nShopify offers 3 pricing plans:\n\n * Basic Shopify: $29/month (for new ecommerce businesses)\n * Shopify: $79/month (best for growing businesses)\n * Advanced Shopify: $299/month (best for scaling businesses)\n\nEach plan progressively offers lower credit card rates for cheaper payment\nprocessing, larger shipping discounts, more staff accounts, advanced reports,\ntax management, and international pricing tools.\n\nPros of Shopify\n * Very intuitive to use. Shopify is one of the most user-friendly software\n   applications out there. You can add products, customize your store pages, set\n   up shipping and taxes, and more without having to touch a single line of\n   code.\n * Large variety of storefront themes. Online sellers can customize their stores\n   any way they want with a wide range of both free and paid themes to choose\n   from. And if you're not satisfied with any of the available themes, you can\n   always hire a Shopify Expert to create a custom theme for you.\n * Helps streamline your marketing and discounts. On Shopify, you can easily\n   generate discount codes, create separate SEO headings and descriptions, send\n   emails, and track your store's analytics all in one place. There are a ton of \n   automation tools to help boost your sales too\n   [https://www.weblime.com/stories/ecommerce-marketing-automation/].\n * There's a Shopify app store (with a lot of apps). Some online businesses\n   swear by particular apps that have single-handedly supercharged their sales.\n   One example is SMS bump (text marketing). Shopify gives your online store\n   access to thousands of unique apps that allow you to take your customer\n   experience and business management to a new level.\n * Fantastic customer support. One of the things that sets Shopify apart from\n   other ecommerce platforms is its excellent customer support. Whenever you\n   have a question or run into a problem, you can always contact Shopify's\n   support team 24/7 via live chat, email, or phone.\n\nCons of Shopify\n * Limited control over some aspects of your store. Because Shopify is a hosted\n   platform, you can't make any changes to the server-side code or add custom\n   plugins that haven't been approved by Shopify.\n * Some plugins and apps can get costly in the long run. Alongside the monthly\n   fee to Shopify, you may have to pay for a lot of the nifty tools that can\n   elevate your shopper experience.\n\nAbout Amazon FBA\nAmazon was founded in 1994 by Jeff Bezos. At first, it was an online bookstore,\nbut it soon expanded to include all sorts of products, a to z. Now, they're the\nlargest online retailer in the world and offer a wide range of services like\necommerce, cloud computing, and digital streaming. They’re also known for their\nexcellent customer service.\n\nHow does selling on Amazon work?\nWhen you set up your Amazon Seller account, you'll need to provide some basic\ninformation about your business, including your name, contact information, and\ntype of business.\n\nOnce you're approved as an Amazon seller, you'll be able to create listings for\nthe products you want to sell. You'll need to provide a title, product\ndescription, price, and shipping information. You can also upload product\nimages.\n\nWhen a customer buys one of your products, Amazon will notify you and ship the\nitem to the customer on your behalf. You'll need to pay Amazon a fee for each\nsale, as well as a monthly subscription fee.\n\nIf you're looking for an ecommerce platform that's easy to use and offers a wide\nrange of features, Amazon is a good option. However, there are a few things to\nkeep in mind before you start selling.\n\nAmazon FBA key features\n 1. Product research tools. Amazon provides a few different tools to help you\n    research which products are selling well and would be a good fit for your\n    business.\n 2. Automatic listing and repricing. Once you find a product that you want to\n    sell, you can list it on Amazon with just a few clicks. Amazon will also\n    automatically reprice your products based on competitor prices, so you don't\n    have to worry about manually changing your prices.\n 3. Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) program. Amazon offers fulfillment services to\n    help you with the logistics of shipping and customer service. When you use\n    FBA, Amazon will store your products in their warehouses and ship them to\n    customers when they make a purchase. You'll also have access to Amazon's\n    customer service team.\n\nAmazon Pricing\nWhen it comes to selling on Amazon, your costs will depend on your\n\n * Selling plan [https://sell.amazon.com/pricing#selling-plans] ($0.99/units\n   sold or $39.99 monthly)\n * Referral fees [https://sell.amazon.com/pricing#referral-fees] (8-15% for\n   using the Amazon brand to make sales)\n * Fulfillment fees [https://sell.amazon.com/pricing#fulfillment-fees]\n * Other costs [https://sell.amazon.com/pricing#other-costs] like long-term\n   storage.\n\nOf course, with all those recurring fees, Amazon will glady handle the product\ninsurance, care, delivery, customer service, and overall management. You just\nneed HD product photos and videos, strong descriptions, and good review\n[https://www.weblime.com/stories/how-to-add-reviews-on-shopify/]s.\n\nPros of selling on Amazon\n * A lot of traffic already. When you sell on Amazon, you're selling on a site\n   that already gets a ton of traffic. This means that there's a good chance\n   that your products will be seen by potential customers.\n * Familiar buying experience for customers. Customers are already familiar with\n   the Amazon buying experience, so they'll know what to expect when they\n   purchase from you.\n * Low marketing costs. Because Amazon is already so popular and trusted, you\n   won't have to spend as much on marketing and advertising to build that\n   credibility.\n * Super fast delivery. Unlike Shopify where your suppliers will likely use\n   third-party delivery teams that could take anywhere between a week to month,\n   FBA allows every product on your shelf to be delivered with same-day,\n   one-day, or two-day shipping. Some metropolitan areas in the U.S. may even\n   allow two hours!\n * Unparalleled customer service. Amazon is known for its excellent customer\n   service, so you can rest assured that your buyers will be taken care of if\n   they have any questions or problems, without any extra involvment from you.\n\nCons of selling on Amazon\n * You'll need to pay fees. Unlike Shopify, which has a monthly subscription\n   fee, Amazon charges sellers a per-sale fee as well as a monthly subscription\n   fee.\n * You may need to invest in additional tools. While Amazon does provide some\n   tools for sellers, you may need to invest in additional software to help you\n   manage your inventory and shipping.\n * There's a lot of competition. Because Amazon is such a popular platform,\n   there's a lot of competition among sellers. This means that you'll need to\n   work hard to make your listings stand out.\n * Lack of control over storytelling and branding. On Amazon, your product\n   listings will look very similar to everyone else's. For the most part, you're\n   using pre-built formatting and design, so it can be difficult to tell your\n   brand's story and build a strong connection with customers.\n\nThe verdict: Shopify or Amazon?\nSo, which eCommerce platform is right for you? As you can see, it really depends\non your needs and preferences. If you're looking for a trustworthy marketplace\nto sell your goods with a more \"hands-off\" approach, Amazon is a good option.\nHowever, if you want more control (CEO vibes) over your branding and\nstorytelling, Shopify may be a better fit.\n\nNo matter which platform you choose, the most important thing is to start\nbuilding your eCommerce business today. While it can be difficult navigating\neither platform, it doesn't have to be with Weblime's in-house designers and\ncopywriters who are at-the-ready to deliver your message attractively and\ncompellingly.\n\nNeed help building your eCommerce store?

It can be a scary step, but it will feel more\nlike a comfortable step into the future if you have the right tools, like the\nright blogging platform.\n\nYou might not know how important it is to choose the right blogging platform for\nyour photography business. The truth is—when you publish photos on different\nplatforms like Instagram or Facebook, only a tiny percentage of viewers actually\nsee them. And when viewers do see them, they’re often fed more, so it’s hard for\nthem to keep up with everything you’ve done, which leaves them feeling\ndisconnected from your work.\n\nA blog is different from these other platforms because it is all about building\nan online presence on your website. Your blog\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog] will be constantly updated with new content\nto help your audience connect with what you have to share. The most successful\nbloggers post anywhere from 2-5 times a week and repost their previous posts to\nkeep their content fresh and easily accessible. No matter how many times you\nrepost, if you choose the right platform for bloggers, people will always be\nable to find new content to maintain a connection and feel like they’re part of\nsomething.\n\nBenefits of a photography blog\nThe benefits of creating a blog for your photography business are infinite. We\ncan think of a few things as exciting as having a blog to share your photos,\nexpress yourself, and let the world know what you do.\n\nBlogging is often one of the biggest factors in the success of photographers.\nHere are just a few of the many reasons why you should start blogging:\n\n * Showcase your work and build an online portfolio. One of the best ways to get\n   noticed is to have your work seen by as many people as possible—and with a\n   blog, you can easily do that.\n * Build your brand and gain exposure. Blogging is a great way to increase\n   traffic to your website, grow your social media following, and improve SEO\n   for your website or business.\n * Connect with like-minded people and build a community. Building relationships\n   within the photography community is one of the best ways to stay inspired,\n   grow as an artist, improve your photography skills and knowledge, find\n   clients, and generally enjoy being part of a supportive network where you can\n   share ideas.\n * Share your knowledge and expertise. As well as helping you connect with other\n   photographers, you can use blogging as a platform for sharing what you know\n   about photography with others—and when they see how much value they're\n   getting from reading what you write, they'll be more likely to want to come\n   back for more!\n\nBest blogging platforms for photographers\nWordPress is the most popular blogging platform for photographers. It offers a\nhigh degree of flexibility, including the ability to customize your site's\ndesign, add plugins, and integrate an online store. Tumblr isn't a traditional\nblogging platform, but it's another good option for photography blogs. The\nservice lets you create a photography blog easily, sharing just one shot or\nseveral in each post.\n\nGhost is another platform that promises photographers \"the best publishing tools\non the planet,\" according to its website. Ghost has a sleek interface and makes\nit easy to share links, videos, and photos in posts. You can even choose from\nmore than 100 themes to match your photography blog's style and personality.\n\nOn the other hand, Wix is one of the most accessible options for building a\nphotography blog without coding skills. Squarespace is another user-friendly\nsite builder that offers plenty of templates explicitly designed with\nphotographers in mind (including special features like slideshows).\n\nWordPress\nWordPress is the oldest and most widely used blogging platform. It boasts a huge\ndeveloper community that has created over 50,000 plugins and thousands of\nthemes. Because WordPress is open-source, you don’t have to pay for the platform\nitself or most plugins and themes. There are two versions of WordPress:\n\n * WordPress.com—This version of WordPress gives you access to hundreds of free\n   themes and thousands of free plugins. In its free starter plan, you also get\n   unlimited storage space, which is ideal for photographers with large files\n   that take up more storage space than text-heavy sites. However, it doesn’t\n   offer a free custom domain name; instead, it provides a subdomain\n   (yourblog.wordpress.com).\n * WordPress.org—WordPress's self-hosted version allows you to host your blog on\n   your server so you can customize anything without worrying about someone\n   shutting down your blog.\n\nCheck out our WordPress guide\n[https://www.weblime.com/stories/the-ultimate-wordpress-guide] if you decide to\ngo in this route.\n\nGhost\nGhost is a blogging platform that has taken the world by storm. It's been\npraised for its easy-to-use interface and customization options, allowing users\nto create their ideal website.\n\nGhost’s team also created a simple editor to write your stories and blog posts\neasily, as well as an author section where you can introduce yourself to\nvisitors with your author bio.\n\nGhost has built-in SEO options and code injection capabilities, so it's always\ngood to go for search engine ranking or quick compatibility fixes. You’ll also\nbe able to publish your content directly on Facebook, Twitter, or other social\nmedia channels from Ghost’s dashboard.\n\nGhost is an excellent option for photographers if you're looking for an\neasy-to-use blogging platform focused on writing!\n\nWix\nThe truth is, Wix is a powerful tool that allows you to build truly beautiful\nwebsites. The platform has many unique features, including templates perfect for\nphotographers. You can create photo galleries with albums and photos easily\ncustomizable via drag and drop. You also have access to great editing tools,\nlike lightbox and automatic image optimization. This makes creating high-quality\nsites a snap.\n\nSquarespace\nSquarespace is a popular and easy-to-use website builder that offers several\ntemplates for photographers. If you’re not experienced with coding and want to\nput together a portfolio quickly, Squarespace is a great choice. The platform is\nextremely user-friendly, making it easy to add your images and set up your site\nin just hours. You can also take advantage of the support community or search\nthrough the help forums if you need extra assistance creating your photography\nwebsite.\n\nLimey\nWhen photographers do business with clients, they often have to send the client\na portfolio, which is only accessible via the photographer's website. Moreover,\nthe photographer’s portfolio could live on different platforms, making it hard\nto decide which link to send to a potential client.\n\nThe problem with this solution is that there is no way for clients to easily get\na sense of what kind of work the photographer does and how they could\npotentially help them.\n\nThat's why we created Limey [https://limey.io/]. Limey is a landing page builder\nthat helps photographers easily create digital business cards for their relevant\nportfolios (e.g., Shutterstock, Behance). Limey allows photographers to add\nlinks to their existing online portfolios and populate their landing pages with\nlinks to any websites they want to refer clients to. Clients will be able to\nvisit these pages and immediately get an idea of what kind of services or\nproducts a specific photographer offers.\n\nPick the right blogging platform to save time, energy, and effort so that you\ncan focus on what's important.\nOne of the most important decisions you’ll make as a blogger is choosing a\nblogging platform. The right blogging platform for your needs can help you save\ntime, energy, and effort to focus on what’s important – putting your best foot\nforward.\n\nThe following are some of the criteria we recommend thinking about when choosing\nyour photography blog platform:\n\n * Ease of use – an easy to use interface will save you time and money. You\n   won’t have to spend hours learning how to use it or fork over big bucks for\n   someone else to do it for you. Some popular platforms may seem easy at first\n   glance, but they can become complicated if customization is needed once you\n   dig deeper.\n * Features – Is there room to grow? Can the platform evolve with your changing\n   needs? Does it allow plugins or themes that will help expand its\n   capabilities? Will it provide everything you need now and in the future?\n * Branding – Does the platform allow complete control over your content and\n   branding? If branding matters to you, then choose carefully. Some platforms\n   add watermarks and links back to themselves and control what content goes on\n   your site. Avoid these unless this is acceptable to you.\n\nYou now have a pretty good idea of what you should be looking for in a\nphotography blog platform.\n\nThe most important thing to remember is that the perfect platform doesn't exist.\nYou need to pick one that will allow you to focus on what's really important:\nyour photography.","excerpt":"We reviewed the top photography blog platforms on the market.
