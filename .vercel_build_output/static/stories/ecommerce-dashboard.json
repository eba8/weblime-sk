We'll also provide example dashboards for each KPI, so you can get a better understanding of how to track and visualize your data. Let's get started!</p><h3 id=\"what-are-ecommerce-kpis\">What are eCommerce KPIs?</h3><p>Key performance indicators (KPIs) are measurable, quantitative values that help you understand how your ecommerce business is performing. They are not just numbers, but also a means to an end. They help you answer important questions about the current state of your business so you can make informed decisions. For example, a KPI could tell you if your ad campaigns are sending traffic to your website. You can then use this information to make adjustments and improve results.</p><p>A good KPI should have the following attributes:</p><ul><li><strong>Measurable</strong>. If the value is not measurable, it's difficult to analyze and compare it with other metrics. For example, \"readership\" is not a KPI because there's no obvious way to measure it. On the other hand, \"number of social shares of published posts\" is a good KPI because anyone can count the number of shares on Facebook or Twitter and compare it with previous months or years.</li><li><strong><strong><strong>Quantifiable.</strong></strong></strong></li><li><strong><strong><strong>Actionable. </strong></strong></strong>The metric should tell you how customers behave on your website, so you know what actions to take to increase sales. This means you need to track key metrics across all channels—online and offline—to get a complete picture of what's happening in your business.</li></ul><h3 id=\"why-kpis-matter\">Why KPIs matter</h3><p>Key performance indicators (KPIs) provide a way for you to measure the efficacy of your business practices, so that you can make necessary adjustments and hit your benchmarks. Rather than solely relying on instinct or gut feelings, KPIs are derived only through data and analytics. That means they offer an objective way to guide all of your eCommerce initiatives.</p><p>There are three types of KPIs: leading, lagging, and operational. Leading KPIs tell you where you’re going; lagging KPIs tell you how well you’re doing; operational KPIs show where there is room for improvement in terms of processes and procedures. By applying these categories to their eCommerce businesses, retailers have a better chance at improving performance overall.</p><h3 id=\"every-business-has-unique-kpis-to-measure-and-track\">Every business has unique KPIs to measure and track</h3><p>There are a number of ecommerce metrics you should be tracking in order to monitor the health of your business. However, every business is unique and has its own unique set of KPIs that it needs to measure and track.</p><p>What are the most important aspects of your business that you need to measure? What do you need to know as a baseline in order to identify areas for improvement or optimization?</p><p>A data-driven approach is key when it comes to understanding what’s working and not working for your business, so we highly recommend building out dashboards for the following three reasons:</p><ul><li>They help maintain focus on the essential metrics in your business.</li><li>They eliminate guesswork by showing you exactly where things stand today.</li><li>They allow you to quickly spot red flags and opportunities within your business so that you can take action right away.</li></ul><p>Let’s have a look at eCommerce dashboards below!</p><h3 id=\"what-is-an-ecommerce-dashboard\">What is an eCommerce dashboard?</h3><p>A dashboard in eCommerce is a collection of key performance indicators (KPIs) that allow business owners and managers to track the progress of their online stores. By having access to this data, they can make informed decisions about what changes need to be made in order to improve their business.</p><p>There are many different KPIs that could be tracked on an eCommerce dashboard, but the most important ones vary depending on the type of business. We’ll cover the most common types in the following section.</p><h3 id=\"how-to-set-up-your-ecommerce-dashboard-on-google-analytics\">How to set up your eCommerce dashboard on Google Analytics</h3><p>Creating your eCommerce dashboard is relatively straightforward – just make sure that you have administrative permissions to collaborate, edit, and manage the Google Analytics (GA) account.</p><p>Once that’s ensured, open GA and select <strong>Dashboards </strong>under <strong>Customization </strong>on the left-side menu<strong>.</strong></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://blog.weblime.com/content/images/2022/02/ecommerce-dashboard-google-analytics.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Google Anlaytics  ecommerce dashboards\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1520\" height=\"880\" srcset=\"https://blog.weblime.com/content/images/size/w600/2022/02/ecommerce-dashboard-google-analytics.png 600w, https://blog.weblime.com/content/images/size/w1000/2022/02/ecommerce-dashboard-google-analytics.png 1000w, https://blog.weblime.com/content/images/2022/02/ecommerce-dashboard-google-analytics.png 1520w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p>Then, you’ll want to press the red button labeled <strong>CREATE.</strong></p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://blog.weblime.com/content/images/2022/02/ecommerce-dashboard-create.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"eCommerce dashboard create button\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1600\" height=\"568\" srcset=\"https://blog.weblime.com/content/images/size/w600/2022/02/ecommerce-dashboard-create.png 600w, https://blog.weblime.com/content/images/size/w1000/2022/02/ecommerce-dashboard-create.png 1000w, https://blog.weblime.com/content/images/2022/02/ecommerce-dashboard-create.png 1600w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p>From there, you’ll have two options to either start with a <strong>Blank Canvas </strong>or a <strong>Starter Dashboard </strong>with some preset KPI widgets. We’re also going to cover some templates in a later section, but for now, let’s select a blank canvas.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://blog.weblime.com/content/images/2022/02/ecommerce-Blank-Canvas-Starter-Dashboard.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"eCommerce blank or starter dashboard selection\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1294\" height=\"444\" srcset=\"https://blog.weblime.com/content/images/size/w600/2022/02/ecommerce-Blank-Canvas-Starter-Dashboard.png 600w, https://blog.weblime.com/content/images/size/w1000/2022/02/ecommerce-Blank-Canvas-Starter-Dashboard.png 1000w, https://blog.weblime.com/content/images/2022/02/ecommerce-Blank-Canvas-Starter-Dashboard.png 1294w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p>You’ll be met with options to add six types of widgets to your dashboard:</p><p>After that, it’s about choosing your KPI metrics.

(+ example widgets)</h3><p>Sales metrics</p><p>These are bread and butter metrics for any eCommerce business. You can use these numbers to set objectives or KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) for your company and team as a whole. Ecommerce sales data show you the effectiveness of your online presence, web content, product pages, and product offers.</p><p>What are we talking about exactly? Check it out:</p><ul><li><strong>Total revenue</strong>. This macro metric lets you keep track of your annual sales goals. If you see that you're not exactly on track, you may want to inform stakeholders, reevaluate your pricing, or change your marketing strategy. We'd recommend tracking your total revenue against your total costs for a better idea of your overall performance (doubling revenue doesn't mean much if you doubled costs for example).</li></ul><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://blog.weblime.com/content/images/2022/02/Total-revenue-ecommercre-dashboard.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Total revenue dashboard\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"916\" height=\"194\" srcset=\"https://blog.weblime.com/content/images/size/w600/2022/02/Total-revenue-ecommercre-dashboard.png 600w, https://blog.weblime.com/content/images/2022/02/Total-revenue-ecommercre-dashboard.png 916w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><ul><li><strong>Average conversion rate. </strong>This metric tells you how many people are taking your desired action (typically, making a purchase). If this number is low, it could mean that you need to work on your website's design, your marketing strategy, or the relevancy of your products. Clearly, what you have going on isn't working for the masses.</li><li><strong>Shopping cart abandonment rate.</strong> Did you know that the<a href=\"https://baymard.com/lists/cart-abandonment-rate\"> average cart abandonment rate is 69.82%</a>? It's one of the most common hurdles for eCommerce managers. This metric will tell you how well you're closing customers in the last steps of the buying process. If your abandonment rate is absurdly high, that could indicate a buggy checkout process, lack of information (return policy, payment options, shipping details), or poor/non-existent remarketing efforts.</li><li><strong>Number of transactions.</strong> This metric is a good proxy for customer engagement. If you see that this number is dropping, it could be an indication that customers are finding your site less engaging, or that you need to work on your user experience (UX).</li></ul><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://blog.weblime.com/content/images/2022/02/unique-visitors-transactions-dashboard.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Dashboard for number of transactions from unique visitors\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"920\" height=\"502\" srcset=\"https://blog.weblime.com/content/images/size/w600/2022/02/unique-visitors-transactions-dashboard.png 600w, https://blog.weblime.com/content/images/2022/02/unique-visitors-transactions-dashboard.png 920w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><ul><li><strong>Average order value (AOV). </strong>How much money are people spending on average when they make a purchase on your site? Generally, you want to keep this number consistent or increase gradually. If you see that this number is dropping, it could be an indication that you need to offer more expensive items or increase the perceived value of your products.</li></ul><h3 id=\"digital-marketing-metrics\">Digital Marketing metrics</h3><p>If you're running a digital marketing campaign (e.g. PPC, social media, email/SMS marketing), it's important to track the results of those campaigns using eCommerce KPIs.</p><p>This will help you determine whether or not the money you're spending on marketing is worth it, and whether you need to restrategize your approach.</p><ul><li><strong>Total traffic (users).</strong> This metric tells you how many people are visiting your website. If this number is dropping, it could mean that you're not reaching your target audience, or that your marketing campaigns aren't effective (e.g. CTAs need work or targeting is off).</li><li>If your traffic is rather high, then it's time to compare it against your conversions to see if you're making the most out of your traffic – you may find that you need to conversion-optimize your web pages. On Google Analytics, you can use the geomap widget for a clear display of your total page views.</li></ul><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://blog.weblime.com/content/images/2022/02/pageviews-dashboard-geo.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Geomap widget for page views\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"716\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https://blog.weblime.com/content/images/size/w600/2022/02/pageviews-dashboard-geo.png 600w, https://blog.weblime.com/content/images/2022/02/pageviews-dashboard-geo.png 716w\"></figure><ul><li><strong>Traffic sources.</strong> You can drill down further into the traffic metric and see which channels are driving the most traffic (organic search, paid search, social media, etc.). By doing so, you can double down on what's working and identify the reasons behind your weak-performing channels (e.g. maybe your target market isn't active on Instagram, so you should allocate more resources elsewhere).</li></ul><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://blog.weblime.com/content/images/2022/02/Traffic-sources-unique-visitors.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Widget for traffic sources from unique visitors\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"908\" height=\"406\" srcset=\"https://blog.weblime.com/content/images/size/w600/2022/02/Traffic-sources-unique-visitors.png 600w, https://blog.weblime.com/content/images/2022/02/Traffic-sources-unique-visitors.png 908w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><ul><li><strong>Bounce rate.</strong> If a high percentage of your website visitors are leaving immediately, that's known as a bounce rate. This metric tells you how engaged (or not) people are with your site. You want to aim for a low bounce rate, as it usually means that people are finding what they're looking for on your site and don't need to look any further. But if you have a high one, you may need to take a hard look at your website and identify what's turning off users (slow load times, poor UX design, unclear copy, etc.)</li><li><strong>Number of top organic keywords.</strong> This metric tells you which keywords are driving the most traffic to your website so you can optimize for them further. If a certain keyword isn't performing well, you can add it to your list of negative keywords in your PPC campaigns or update your SEO strategy.</li><li><strong>Customer acquisition cost for paid traffic.</strong> How much are you spending to acquire a customer through paid channels? This metric will help you determine whether or not the money you're spending is worth it. Ideally, you want this number to be lower than your lifetime customer value (LTV).</li><li><strong>Customer lifetime value (CLV). </strong>This metric tells you how much a customer is worth to you over the entire duration that they're a customer. It's important to track this number so you can make sure that your marketing campaigns are profitable in the long run. For example, if you're spending $10 to acquire a customer but their CLV is only $5, then you're losing money with each customer that you acquire.</li></ul><h3 id=\"customer-satisfaction-metrics\">Customer satisfaction metrics</h3><ul><li><strong>Number of repeat customers. </strong>This tells you how many of your customers are returning to make another purchase. If this number is low, it could mean that you need to work on your branding or customer service in order to keep people coming back.</li><li><strong>Customer satisfaction rating. </strong>This metric gives you an idea of how happy your customers are with your products and services. A high rating is obviously a good thing, but you may also want to compare it against your customer retention rate to see if there's a discrepancy.</li><li><strong>Net promoter score (NPS). </strong>This metric measures how likely customers are to recommend your products or services to others. A high NPS indicates that you have a lot of happy and loyal customers, while a low score could mean that you need to work on your customer service.</li></ul><p>So there you have it – some key eCommerce KPIs that will help you drive data-driven growth in your business. Keep an eye on these metrics and make sure to track them on your dashboard over time so you can see how your efforts are impacting your bottom line.</p><h3 id=\"5-great-ecommerce-dashboard-templates-that-you-can-use-for-your-online-store\">5 great eCommerce dashboard templates that you can use for your online store</h3><p>Before exploring this section, remember that eCommerce dashboards vary from business to business.
