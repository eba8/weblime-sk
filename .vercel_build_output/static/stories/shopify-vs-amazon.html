It's a special moment.</p><p>This is <em>your </em>business. Your 9-5 (or maybe 6-11). You want nothing but the best for it. And part of that means choosing the right platform to set up shop. Naturally, your decision comes down to the two industry titans: Amazon vs Shopify.</p><p>While both eCommerce platforms allow third-party vendors to sell their products, Shopify and Amazon have some important distinctions that you need to consider before launching your own eCommerce business.</p><p>At <a href="https://www.weblime.com/">Weblime</a>, we're going to cover everything you need to know about both with in-depth reviews so you can decide which ecommerce platform is best for you.</p><h3 id="shopify-vs-amazon-key-differences">Shopify vs Amazon: Key differences</h3><ul><li><strong>While Shopify is a specialized ecommerce platform, Amazon is more of an online marketplace. </strong>On Shopify, you can build your own standalone online store from the ground up. But on Amazon, you're selling products on the Amazon marketplace, where millions of people shop already, alongside other third-party sellers. So while you need to <em>build</em> an audience for your Shopify store (a private entity), you're tapping <em>into </em>an audience with Amazon FBA (a public marketplace).</li><li><strong>Shopify is brand-centric, Amazon is Amazon-centric. </strong>On Shopify, you're building your own brand – a separate entity. That means investing in long-term <a href="https://www.weblime.com/stories/ultimate-guide-to-digital-marketing/">digital marketing</a> efforts on social media, search engines (<a href="https://www.embarque.io/post/global-seo">SEO</a>), and handling public relations. Customer service is also your responsibility and reflects on your brand image. But with Amazon, merchants give up most of the spotlight (branding, custom design, customer support) while they collect sales revenue behind the curtain.</li><li><strong>Shopify is more hands-on (lower costs), Amazon is more hands-off (higher costs).</strong> To build and operate your own online store using Shopify's ecommerce tools,<a href="https://www.shopify.ca/pricing?term=shopify%20plans&amp;adid=565729915161&amp;campaignid=15436644442&amp;branded_enterprise=1&amp;BOID=brand&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwsJ6TBhAIEiwAfl4TWMnOHbcP09pf9RwKyAZPOjoJAc-38rmjIUOemp-avZ_mqcrythFKrhoCiqYQAvD_BwE&amp;cmadid=516586854;cmadvertiserid=10730501;cmcampaignid=26990768;cmplacementid=324494812;cmcreativeid=163722649;cmsiteid=5500011"> </a>monthly subscriptions are available for different sized businesses. You'll need to find your own suppliers (through Aliexpress, Alibaba, or Zendrop, etc.), monitor product delivery, and handle customer service issues. With Amazon everything from product insurance, care, delivery, customer service, and overall management is taken care of. You just have to supply product media and copy, along with paying recurring costs like your selling plan, referral fees, fulfillment fees , and other expenses like long-term storage.</li></ul><h3 id="what-is-shopify">What is Shopify?</h3><p>Shopify is a Canadian eCommerce company founded in 2006 by Tobias Lütke, Daniel Weinand, and Scott Lake. Their bread and butter is pretty straightforward: an eCommerce platform for businesses of all sizes to create an online store. It's used by some of the world's largest brands, including Tesla, General Electric, Budweiser, Red Bull, and Nestle.</p><h3 id="shopify%E2%80%99s-key-features">Shopify’s key features:</h3><ol><li><strong>A customizable platform: </strong>Shopify offers users a customizable platform to build their own online store. You can choose from a variety of Shopify themes or <a href="https://www.weblime.com/stories/shopify-marketing-agency/">hire a professional team</a> to add custom code to personalize the look and feel you want for your online store. And with the Shopify App store, you can add all sorts of nifty conversion-boosting features and functionalities.</li><li><strong>Wide range of integrations:</strong> Shopify's interface is designed to be easy-to-use because 99% of applications don't need technical experience, thanks to integrations. For example, with Google and Facebook, you can easily set up your traffic and audience engagement trackers (pixels), which normally involve coding knowledge. Other plugins can help you <a href="https://www.weblime.com/stories/shopify-automation/">automate repetitive processes</a>.</li><li><strong>Integrated email marketing: </strong>With Shopify, you can send automated emails to your customers based on their interactions with your store. For example, you can set up an abandoned cart email campaign to recover lost sales, a customer retention email series to keep your customers engaged, and post-purchase emails to cross-sell or upsell products. All of these are customizable and require no coding knowledge.</li><li><strong>A built-in blog: </strong>Shopify has a built-in blogging feature that lets you easily create content to drive traffic and engage your customers. You can write blog posts, create product pages, and add other types of content to your store. And with Shopify's SEO features, you can optimize your content so that it ranks higher in search engines.</li><li><strong>Shopify payments: </strong>With Shopify Payments, you can accept credit cards and other forms of payment on your store without having to set up a third-party payment processor. Shopify Payments is available in the US, Canada, UK, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, and Singapore.</li></ol><p>Although you can edit your store page and navigate rather intuitively on Amazon, it simply doesn't offer the same suite of store and brand-building tools because again, Amazon isn't too focused on providing third-party merchants personal branding power.</p><h3 id="shopify-pricing">Shopify Pricing</h3><p>Shopify offers 3 pricing plans:</p><ul><li>Basic Shopify: $29/month (for new ecommerce businesses)</li><li>Shopify: $79/month (best for growing businesses)</li><li>Advanced Shopify: $299/month (best for scaling businesses)</li></ul><p>Each plan progressively offers lower credit card rates for cheaper payment processing, larger shipping discounts, more staff accounts, advanced reports, tax management, and international pricing tools.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/nrzYRorhk2Z5fv8LucfNDzvWYxghnf_mxCGVdJo6pc6J5TNes1zMQ2RrLAjLOwxgMPq7S6Lmo1fpNmSFxFFdINj5jUg2j22W7vO90fiwR7eNo6_jdEqy3Uy7JwQYNa-uFczFYwcklUP_gSW0TA" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy"></figure><h3 id="pros-of-shopify">Pros of Shopify</h3><ul><li><strong>Very intuitive to use.</strong> Shopify is one of the most user-friendly software applications out there. You can add products, customize your store pages, set up shipping and taxes, and more without having to touch a single line of code.</li><li><strong>Large variety of storefront themes.</strong> Online sellers can customize their stores any way they want with a wide range of both free and paid themes to choose from. And if you're not satisfied with any of the available themes, you can always hire a Shopify Expert to create a custom theme for you.</li><li><strong>Helps streamline your marketing and discounts. </strong>On Shopify, you can easily generate discount codes, create separate SEO headings and descriptions, send emails, and track your store's analytics all in one place. There are a ton of <a href="https://www.weblime.com/stories/ecommerce-marketing-automation/">automation tools to help boost your sales too</a>.</li><li><strong>There's a Shopify app store (with </strong><em><strong>a lot </strong></em><strong>of apps).</strong> Some online businesses swear by particular apps that have single-handedly supercharged their sales. One example is SMS bump (text marketing). Shopify gives your online store access to thousands of unique apps that allow you to take your customer experience and business management to a new level.</li><li><strong>Fantastic customer support.</strong> One of the things that sets Shopify apart from other ecommerce platforms is its excellent customer support. Whenever you have a question or run into a problem, you can always contact Shopify's support team 24/7 via live chat, email, or phone.</li></ul><h3 id="cons-of-shopify">Cons of Shopify</h3><ul><li><strong>Limited control over some aspects of your store. </strong>Because Shopify is a hosted platform, you can't make any changes to the server-side code or add custom plugins that haven't been approved by Shopify.</li><li><strong>Some plugins and apps can get costly in the long run.</strong> Alongside the monthly fee to Shopify, you may have to pay for a lot of the nifty tools that can elevate your shopper experience.</li></ul><h3 id="about-amazon-fba">About Amazon FBA</h3><p>Amazon was founded in 1994 by Jeff Bezos. At first, it was an online bookstore, but it soon expanded to include all sorts of products, a to z. Now, they're the largest online retailer in the world and offer a wide range of services like ecommerce, cloud computing, and digital streaming. They’re also known for their excellent customer service.</p><h3 id="how-does-selling-on-amazon-work">How does selling on Amazon work?</h3><p>When you set up your Amazon Seller account, you'll need to provide some basic information about your business, including your name, contact information, and type of business.</p><p>Once you're approved as an Amazon seller, you'll be able to create listings for the products you want to sell. You'll need to provide a title, product description, price, and shipping information. You can also upload product images.</p><p>When a customer buys one of your products, Amazon will notify you and ship the item to the customer on your behalf. You'll need to pay Amazon a fee for each sale, as well as a monthly subscription fee.</p><p>If you're looking for an ecommerce platform that's easy to use and offers a wide range of features, Amazon is a good option. However, there are a few things to keep in mind before you start selling.</p><h3 id="amazon-fba-key-features">Amazon FBA key features</h3><ol><li><strong>Product research tools. </strong>Amazon provides a few different tools to help you research which products are selling well and would be a good fit for your business.</li><li><strong>Automatic listing and repricing.</strong> Once you find a product that you want to sell, you can list it on Amazon with just a few clicks. Amazon will also automatically reprice your products based on competitor prices, so you don't have to worry about manually changing your prices.</li><li><strong>Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) program. </strong>Amazon offers fulfillment services to help you with the logistics of shipping and customer service. When you use FBA, Amazon will store your products in their warehouses and ship them to customers when they make a purchase. You'll also have access to Amazon's customer service team.</li></ol><h3 id="amazon-pricing">Amazon Pricing</h3><p>When it comes to selling on Amazon, your costs will depend on your</p><ul><li><a href="https://sell.amazon.com/pricing#selling-plans">Selling plan</a> ($0.99/units sold or $39.99 monthly)</li><li><a href="https://sell.amazon.com/pricing#referral-fees">Referral fees</a> (8-15% for using the Amazon brand to make sales)</li><li><a href="https://sell.amazon.com/pricing#fulfillment-fees">Fulfillment fees</a></li><li><a href="https://sell.amazon.com/pricing#other-costs">Other costs</a> like long-term storage.</li></ul><p>Of course, with all those recurring fees, Amazon will glady handle the product insurance, care, delivery, customer service, and overall management. You just need HD product photos and videos, strong descriptions, and <a href="https://www.weblime.com/stories/how-to-add-reviews-on-shopify/">good review</a>s.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/FyflfgszZD_6pWHDjJ6P5LCI1EbQ2DoqlX9oVvwt3rfr_yP6ivb52rKzp5pD0tQzRLuHcEs1GsKYM17yg5QZ55d8jVAanElPsqBLZKWoXBM9HmYCQBH0kEjTm-pjJRQkZAi_W1N_BKxGyr2yyA" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy"></figure><h3 id="pros-of-selling-on-amazon">Pros of selling on Amazon</h3><ul><li><strong>A lot of traffic already.</strong> When you sell on Amazon, you're selling on a site that already gets a ton of traffic. This means that there's a good chance that your products will be seen by potential customers.</li><li><strong>Familiar buying experience for customers. </strong>Customers are already familiar with the Amazon buying experience, so they'll know what to expect when they purchase from you.</li><li><strong>Low marketing costs. </strong>Because Amazon is already so popular and trusted, you won't have to spend as much on marketing and advertising to build that credibility.</li><li><strong>Super fast delivery.</strong> Unlike Shopify where your suppliers will likely use third-party delivery teams that could take anywhere between a week to month, FBA allows every product on your shelf to be delivered with same-day, one-day, or two-day shipping. Some metropolitan areas in the U.S. may even allow two hours!</li><li><strong>Unparalleled customer service. </strong>Amazon is known for its excellent customer service, so you can rest assured that your buyers will be taken care of if they have any questions or problems, without any extra involvment from you.</li></ul><h3 id="cons-of-selling-on-amazon">Cons of selling on Amazon</h3><ul><li><strong>You'll need to pay fees. </strong>Unlike Shopify, which has a monthly subscription fee, Amazon charges sellers a per-sale fee as well as a monthly subscription fee.</li><li><strong>You may need to invest in additional tools.</strong> While Amazon does provide some tools for sellers, you may need to invest in additional software to help you manage your inventory and shipping.</li><li><strong>There's a lot of competition.</strong> Because Amazon is such a popular platform, there's a lot of competition among sellers.

As you can see, it really depends on your needs and preferences. If you're looking for a trustworthy marketplace to sell your goods with a more "hands-off" approach, Amazon is a good option.

It's a special moment.\\n\\nThis is your business. Your 9-5 (or maybe 6-11). You want nothing but the best\\nfor it. And part of that means choosing the right platform to set up shop.\\nNaturally, your decision comes down to the two industry titans: Amazon vs\\nShopify.\\n\\nWhile both eCommerce platforms allow third-party vendors to sell their products,\\nShopify and Amazon have some important distinctions that you need to consider\\nbefore launching your own eCommerce business.\\n\\nAt Weblime [https://www.weblime.com/], we're going to cover everything you need\\nto know about both with in-depth reviews so you can decide which ecommerce\\nplatform is best for you.\\n\\nShopify vs Amazon: Key differences\\n * While Shopify is a specialized ecommerce platform, Amazon is more of an\\n   online marketplace. On Shopify, you can build your own standalone online\\n   store from the ground up. But on Amazon, you're selling products on the\\n   Amazon marketplace, where millions of people shop already, alongside other\\n   third-party sellers. So while you need to build an audience for your Shopify\\n   store (a private entity), you're tapping into an audience with Amazon FBA (a\\n   public marketplace).\\n * Shopify is brand-centric, Amazon is Amazon-centric. On Shopify, you're\\n   building your own brand – a separate entity. That means investing in\\n   long-term digital marketing\\n   [https://www.weblime.com/stories/ultimate-guide-to-digital-marketing/] \\n   efforts on social media, search engines (SEO\\n   [https://www.embarque.io/post/global-seo]), and handling public relations.\\n   Customer service is also your responsibility and reflects on your brand\\n   image. But with Amazon, merchants give up most of the spotlight (branding,\\n   custom design, customer support) while they collect sales revenue behind the\\n   curtain.\\n * Shopify is more hands-on (lower costs), Amazon is more hands-off (higher\\n   costs). To build and operate your own online store using Shopify's ecommerce\\n   tools, \\n   [https://www.shopify.ca/pricing?term=shopify%20plans&adid=565729915161&campaignid=15436644442&branded_enterprise=1&BOID=brand&gclid=CjwKCAjwsJ6TBhAIEiwAfl4TWMnOHbcP09pf9RwKyAZPOjoJAc-38rmjIUOemp-avZ_mqcrythFKrhoCiqYQAvD_BwE&cmadid=516586854;cmadvertiserid=10730501;cmcampaignid=26990768;cmplacementid=324494812;cmcreativeid=163722649;cmsiteid=5500011]\\n   monthly subscriptions are available for different sized businesses. You'll\\n   need to find your own suppliers (through Aliexpress, Alibaba, or Zendrop,\\n   etc.), monitor product delivery, and handle customer service issues. With\\n   Amazon everything from product insurance, care, delivery, customer service,\\n   and overall management is taken care of. You just have to supply product\\n   media and copy, along with paying recurring costs like your selling plan,\\n   referral fees, fulfillment fees , and other expenses like long-term storage.\\n\\nWhat is Shopify?\\nShopify is a Canadian eCommerce company founded in 2006 by Tobias Lütke, Daniel\\nWeinand, and Scott Lake. Their bread and butter is pretty straightforward: an\\neCommerce platform for businesses of all sizes to create an online store. It's\\nused by some of the world's largest brands, including Tesla, General Electric,\\nBudweiser, Red Bull, and Nestle.\\n\\nShopify’s key features:\\n 1. A customizable platform: Shopify offers users a customizable platform to\\n    build their own online store. You can choose from a variety of Shopify\\n    themes or hire a professional team\\n    [https://www.weblime.com/stories/shopify-marketing-agency/] to add custom\\n    code to personalize the look and feel you want for your online store. And\\n    with the Shopify App store, you can add all sorts of nifty\\n    conversion-boosting features and functionalities.\\n 2. Wide range of integrations: Shopify's interface is designed to be\\n    easy-to-use because 99% of applications don't need technical experience,\\n    thanks to integrations. For example, with Google and Facebook, you can\\n    easily set up your traffic and audience engagement trackers (pixels), which\\n    normally involve coding knowledge. Other plugins can help you automate\\n    repetitive processes [https://www.weblime.com/stories/shopify-automation/].\\n 3. Integrated email marketing: With Shopify, you can send automated emails to\\n    your customers based on their interactions with your store. For example, you\\n    can set up an abandoned cart email campaign to recover lost sales, a\\n    customer retention email series to keep your customers engaged, and\\n    post-purchase emails to cross-sell or upsell products. All of these are\\n    customizable and require no coding knowledge.\\n 4. A built-in blog: Shopify has a built-in blogging feature that lets you\\n    easily create content to drive traffic and engage your customers. You can\\n    write blog posts, create product pages, and add other types of content to\\n    your store. And with Shopify's SEO features, you can optimize your content\\n    so that it ranks higher in search engines.\\n 5. Shopify payments: With Shopify Payments, you can accept credit cards and\\n    other forms of payment on your store without having to set up a third-party\\n    payment processor. Shopify Payments is available in the US, Canada, UK,\\n    Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, and Singapore.\\n\\nAlthough you can edit your store page and navigate rather intuitively on Amazon,\\nit simply doesn't offer the same suite of store and brand-building tools because\\nagain, Amazon isn't too focused on providing third-party merchants personal\\nbranding power.\\n\\nShopify Pricing\\nShopify offers 3 pricing plans:\\n\\n * Basic Shopify: $29/month (for new ecommerce businesses)\\n * Shopify: $79/month (best for growing businesses)\\n * Advanced Shopify: $299/month (best for scaling businesses)\\n\\nEach plan progressively offers lower credit card rates for cheaper payment\\nprocessing, larger shipping discounts, more staff accounts, advanced reports,\\ntax management, and international pricing tools.\\n\\nPros of Shopify\\n * Very intuitive to use. Shopify is one of the most user-friendly software\\n   applications out there. You can add products, customize your store pages, set\\n   up shipping and taxes, and more without having to touch a single line of\\n   code.\\n * Large variety of storefront themes. Online sellers can customize their stores\\n   any way they want with a wide range of both free and paid themes to choose\\n   from. And if you're not satisfied with any of the available themes, you can\\n   always hire a Shopify Expert to create a custom theme for you.\\n * Helps streamline your marketing and discounts. On Shopify, you can easily\\n   generate discount codes, create separate SEO headings and descriptions, send\\n   emails, and track your store's analytics all in one place. There are a ton of \\n   automation tools to help boost your sales too\\n   [https://www.weblime.com/stories/ecommerce-marketing-automation/].\\n * There's a Shopify app store (with a lot of apps). Some online businesses\\n   swear by particular apps that have single-handedly supercharged their sales.\\n   One example is SMS bump (text marketing). Shopify gives your online store\\n   access to thousands of unique apps that allow you to take your customer\\n   experience and business management to a new level.\\n * Fantastic customer support. One of the things that sets Shopify apart from\\n   other ecommerce platforms is its excellent customer support. Whenever you\\n   have a question or run into a problem, you can always contact Shopify's\\n   support team 24/7 via live chat, email, or phone.\\n\\nCons of Shopify\\n * Limited control over some aspects of your store. Because Shopify is a hosted\\n   platform, you can't make any changes to the server-side code or add custom\\n   plugins that haven't been approved by Shopify.\\n * Some plugins and apps can get costly in the long run. Alongside the monthly\\n   fee to Shopify, you may have to pay for a lot of the nifty tools that can\\n   elevate your shopper experience.\\n\\nAbout Amazon FBA\\nAmazon was founded in 1994 by Jeff Bezos. At first, it was an online bookstore,\\nbut it soon expanded to include all sorts of products, a to z.

But once you’ve given them your product, how can\\nyou make sure they come back?\\n\\nYou’ll need to analyze your website's metrics, keep track of visitors,\\ncommunicate with potential customers, and the list goes on.\\n\\nThis article will cover the principles of eCommerce marketing automation and how\\nit can make your life easier while your business grows to new levels.\\n\\nWhat is eCommerce marketing automation?\\nEcommerce marketing automation refers to software built to automate repetitive\\nmarketing tasks. This includes following up with leads, sending e-mails, and\\ncollecting information.\\n\\nAutomating your eCommerce marketing can help you free up time by creating and\\nlaunching campaigns. The days when you had to hire people for mundane tasks are\\nlong gone. Developers and companies have created software that will remove the\\nblood, sweat, and tears from repetitive tasks so you can focus on other aspects\\nof your business.\\n\\nWhat does eCommerce marketing automation include?\\nAutomation takes care of marketing and sales engagement while driving \\nmeasurable\\nresults [https://www.weblime.com/stories/ecommerce-dashboard]. It allows you to\\neasily design, execute, and automate your campaigns or tasks across multiple\\ndepartments. You can simultaneously scale up your marketing efforts while\\nachieving a consistent customer experience.\\n\\nAutomation software comes in many different forms. Some simplify workflows,\\nwhile others tackle analysis. Let's take a closer look at four of the most\\nvaluable types of automation software.\\n\\nMarketing Automation Software\\n\\nMarketing automation software is all about simplifying and streamlining your\\nmarketing processes. For example, you can use it to automate repetitive tasks\\nlike email campaigns. Marketing automation tools\\n[https://www.weblime.com/stories/shopify-automation] also help track and analyze\\nmarketing and sales data to easily get a big picture view of all your marketing\\nendeavors.\\n\\nWorkflow automation\\n\\nHigh-volume retailers often use workflow automation tools to ensure their orders\\nare processed efficiently. Workflow automation software can automatically update\\nsystems when orders are shipped or returned, track inventory, and make sure\\ncustomers are billed correctly. Some workflow automation tools can also make\\nrecommendations based on past performance and projected demand.\\n\\nCustomer Relationship Management (CRM) Software\\n\\nCRM software deals with customer interactions on an individual level. This is\\nwhere you'll find information about customers' details, contact information, and\\norder histories. It also allows you to send personalized emails, messages, and\\npromotions to specific customers based on their actions or data. Because of\\nthis, CRM helps improve customer relations significantly by assisting companies\\nin sending the right message to the right person at the right time.\\n\\nWeb Analytics Software\\n\\nWeb Analytics is where you find data about how visitors interact with your\\nwebsite or online store. Tracking metrics like bounce rate, page views per\\nvisit, and time on site are essential for understanding which pages are working\\nbest and which ones need improvement. With data from web analytics software, you\\ncan calculate how well your campaigns are performing and how good your website’s\\nUI/UX is.\\n\\nBest eCommerce Automation Tools\\nNow that you know the main categories of eCommerce marketing automation its time\\nto have a closer look at some of the best tools out there.\\n\\nEmail Marketing Automation Tools\\n\\nTo recap, email marketing automation is a way to deliver emails to customers\\nbased on their behaviors. You can also segment users based on demographics, such\\nas age, location, or behavior.\\n\\nSome examples of email marketing automation include:\\n\\nAbandoned Cart Emails\\n\\nMany users tend to add a product to their carts and never really finish the\\ncheckout process. They might want to save their cart for later, but they simply\\nforget about it in most cases.\\n\\nInstead of losing these customers, you can set up an abandoned cart email\\ncampaign that will automatically send out a message reminding users about the\\nproducts they never really purchased. This can help you increase sales for an\\nextremely low cost, and it’s all automatic.\\n\\nCross-sell and Upsell Emails\\n\\nAfter users purchase a product from your store, they will most likely receive a\\nconfirmation email. This is usually autogenerated by the eCommerce platform you\\nare using. But after they get this initial email, most people never hear back\\nfrom the store they just purchased from.\\n\\nA cross-sell or upsell email campaign automatically sends out a message to your\\nprevious customers so they can come back and buy again. When you set up such a\\ncampaign, you want to make sure that you also include an incentive (like a\\ndiscount coupon) so people will be more likely to reorder from your store.\\n\\nRemember, previous customers are more likely to purchase from you than new\\nusers. This happens because they already trust your business and know that there\\nis nothing to worry about.\\n\\nCustomer Engagement Emails\\n\\nIf your store allows users to create an account, you should have a bunch of\\nuseful information about them. Customer engagement emails are a great way to\\nstrengthen the relationship between your business and users by sending them a\\n“Happy Birthday” message with a special discount.\\n\\nBuilding this relationship will turn customers into brand advocates who will\\nrecommend your store to their friends and family.\\n\\nPromotional Emails\\n\\nSay you have ordered a large quantity of a specific product because your\\nsupplier had a great offer. You now decide to run a campaign and apply a\\ndiscount to that particular product or category.\\n\\nThe best and cheapest way to boost your sales is to set up a promotional email\\ncampaign and let everyone on your list know about your offer.\\n\\nOn the other hand, if your stock runs low on a product and you want to get rid\\nof it to buy its new variant, you can send out a message to your list letting\\nthem know about it.\\n\\nKlaviyo [https://www.klaviyo.com/] - most accessible email marketing automation\\ntool\\nKlaviyo helps e‑commerce businesses collect, analyze and use customer data to\\noptimize marketing strategies and maximize revenue. The platform allows\\ncompanies to send personalized email marketing campaigns to customers.\\n\\nThe best thing about Klaviyo is that it comes with predefined automation\\ntemplates that work out of the box. Let’s have a look at how you can set up your\\nfirst Welcome Series flow.\\n\\nOnce you sign in to Klaviyo, you will see the following screen:\\n\\nNext, you’ll have to click on the Flows menu item on the left side of the page.\\nFlows are automations that will do the heavy lifting of email marketing for you.\\n\\nKlaviyo lets you create separate Lists based on multiple criteria.\\n\\nFor example, you can create a list of:\\n\\n * People that have ordered a specific product;\\n * New users that have signed up to your newsletter;\\n * Existing customers that have purchased from you more than two times.\\n\\nThe possibilities are endless here, but for this example, I am going to consider\\nyou simply having the default “New Subscribers” list.\\n\\nYou will have to click on the “Get Started” button right below the “Welcome\\nEmail” card on the Flows screen.\\n\\nOnce you do that, you’ll see this screen:\\n\\nGo ahead and select your list, then click on continue.\\n\\nThe Flow editor will open up, and it looks like this:\\n\\nBy default, Klaviyo has already added three steps to this Flow:\\n\\n 1. When a new email gets added to your database, it will instantly receive a\\n    Welcome Message.\\n 2. After three days from the previous email, that address will receive an\\n    additional message.\\n 3. After four days from the previous email, that address will receive the last\\n    message in this sequence.\\n\\nNow you want to write and design these emails. You’ll have to click on the first\\nemail box, then click edit on the panel on the left.\\n\\nNow you’ll see a screen that allows you to edit the sender’s name and email\\naddress, subject line, and preview text. Once you complete these fields, you can\\nclick on the “Edit Content” button to take you to the email content editor page.\\n\\nAfter creating the first email, you can click on the “Save Content” button. This\\nwill take you back to the previous page and save all your progress.\\n\\nClick “Done” in the top right corner, and you’ll be taken back to the initial\\nFlow page.\\n\\nThe last step you have to take is to set your first email as “Live.” To do so,\\nclick on the “Draft” text on the bottom left of the email card and select\\n“Live.”\\n\\nCongratulations! You just configured your first email that will be sent\\nautomatically by Klaviyo when a new email address gets added to your list.\\n\\nNow you have to follow the same steps to finish the other two emails. Once you\\nare done, you can click on the “Save & Exit” button in the top right corner:\\n\\nTo make sure your Flow works, look for a small green dot besides its name in the\\nFlows screen:\\n\\nNow that you have your first Flow, it's time to configure more! After all, you\\nwant to automate every aspect of your email marketing efforts completely.\\n\\nClick on the blue “Create Flow” button in the top right corner of the screen.\\n\\nAs I previously mentioned, Klaviyo provides a vast template library you can pick\\nFlows from.\\n\\nKlaviyo is a truly comprehensive email marketing tool that can even automate SMS\\ncampaigns. Because it has so many features, you might feel lost at first, but\\nwith time and a few tutorials, you’ll get the hang of it in no time.\\n\\nAnother email marketing tool you can use is Mailchimp. The great thing about it\\nis that it also acts like a CRM (Customer Relationship Management) platform.\\n\\nMailchimp [https://mailchimp.com/] - an all in one sales automation tool\\nMailchimp is an easy-to-use marketing automation platform for SMBs. You can\\ncreate and send email newsletters, manage your subscriber lists, and track\\ncampaign performance.\\n\\nWith Mailchimp, you can automate tasks like welcoming new subscribers,\\nre-engaging inactive customers, and following up with people after they buy\\nsomething. The platform makes it easy to connect with your audience across\\nvarious channels—email, web, mobile, and more—so you can market smarter and grow\\nfaster.\\n\\nMailChimp has many tools to help your business grow, so you can stay organized,\\nreach customers wherever they are, sell more stuff, and boost your bottom line.\\n\\nCreate Signup Forms\\n\\nGet new subscribers from anywhere on the web, with forms that match the look and\\nfeel of your brand.\\n\\nAnalyze Your Audience Segments\\n\\nSee which groups of subscribers are opening and clicking on emails, so you can\\nfigure out who to send more stuff to.\\n\\nSend the Right Messages to the Right People\\n\\nQuickly target segments like first-time buyers or people who abandoned their\\ncarts to make sure you're constantly sending relevant messages.\\n\\nCompared to Klaviyo, Mailchimp might feel a bit more complicated for first-time\\nusers.\\n\\nNow that you know how to automate your email campaigns is time to look at how\\nyou can integrate this part of your marketing strategy with your store’s\\ninventory. This will not only help your cash flow, but it will open up new\\npossibilities you haven’t even thought of.\\n\\nWorkflow automation\\n\\nWorkflow automation software is designed to streamline manual processes.
