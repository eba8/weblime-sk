Let's go.</p><h3 id=\"benefits-of-automating-your-shopify-store\">Benefits of automating your Shopify store</h3><p>The most successful Shopify stores make millions of dollars in sales with the help of eCommerce automations – that’s because it allows them to:</p><ul><li><strong>Remove the manual work (i.e. room for error). </strong>Manual tasks, especially when repeated frequently, are prone to human error – which can really slow you down and harm your business in the long run. Automations improve your productivity and eliminate errors like incorrect discount codes, backlogged customer service, or shipping delays from manually creating labels.</li><li><strong>Tag customer segments. </strong>Automations can allow eCommerce businesses to tag and group different customers based on age, gender, money spent, and more to personalize marketing material, increase conversions, and...</li><li><strong>Build brand loyalty. </strong>It's much easier and more sustainable to engage with your audience consistently with the help of automations like <a href=\"https://www.klaviyo.com/\">email and SMS marketing</a>. You can start upselling items, provide discounts, or just keep your readers entertained and remind them that you exist.</li><li><strong>Improve data collection and analysis. </strong>When running a Shopify store, you have <em>loads </em>of data from a haystack of sources. Automating your data collection and analysis methods can help you make better-informed decisions for remarketing, site optimization, and messaging. So that you have a proper way to monitor and track your performance, it's important to distinguish your <a href=\"https://www.weblime.com/stories/ecommerce-dashboard/\">KPI metrics</a> early on. </li><li><strong>Scale faster. </strong>Growing your online business fast has never been easier with Shopify automations that can replace entire human teams with a couple of apps to significantly reduce your costs and time spent (think automated customer service, data tracking, fraud detection, marketing).</li></ul><p>In the next sections, we’re going to be looking at some actionable tips complemented with top eCommerce automation tools that you can start using today.</p><p>So here’s how to automate your Shopify store as much as possible.</p><h3 id=\"personalize-the-shopping-experience-with-smart-on-site-product-recommendations\">Personalize the shopping experience with smart on-site product recommendations</h3><p>Let’s be real – you can’t just stalk <em>every</em> customer, note which products they’re looking at, and try to recommend similar products to personalize their shopping experience. It’s damn near impossible and definitely not practical. But there are eCommerce automation tools like <a href=\"https://www.limespot.com/shopify?utm_term=%2Bpersonalizer%20%2Bshopify&amp;utm_campaign=&amp;utm_source=adwords&amp;utm_medium=ppc&amp;hsa_acc=6674165603&amp;hsa_cam=13066623349&amp;hsa_grp=131085175363&amp;hsa_ad=571264318781&amp;hsa_src=g&amp;hsa_tgt=kwd-1260460846214&amp;hsa_kw=%2Bpersonalizer%20%2Bshopify&amp;hsa_mt=b&amp;hsa_net=adwords&amp;hsa_ver=3&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiA3rKQBhCNARIsACUEW_a_BqF5HeexD698JCOzuN9HKHC_cuTbD2z9nu92JCYNbb4clTZIaV8aAmisEALw_wcB\">LimeSpot</a> that can do this for you.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://blog.weblime.com/content/images/2022/02/Limespot-product-performance-analytics.jpeg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"LimeSpot Shopify analytics dashboard\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1198\" height=\"674\" srcset=\"https://blog.weblime.com/content/images/size/w600/2022/02/Limespot-product-performance-analytics.jpeg 600w, https://blog.weblime.com/content/images/size/w1000/2022/02/Limespot-product-performance-analytics.jpeg 1000w, https://blog.weblime.com/content/images/2022/02/Limespot-product-performance-analytics.jpeg 1198w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p>By tracking and learning from on-site user behavior (e.g. browsed products), these apps will automatically present smart product recommendations catered to the user’s real interests as they scroll your site. You could also <strong>upsell</strong> other related products when a customer is on a specific product page.</p><h3 id=\"don%E2%80%99t-abandon-your-carts-like-customers-do-%E2%80%93-recapture-their-interest-instead\">Don’t abandon your carts like customers do – recapture their interest instead.</h3><p>Welcome to one of the biggest “<em>ughs” </em>of every eCommerce business owner. We lose over <a href=\"https://www.dynamicyield.com/blog/shopping-cart-abandonment-ebook-announcement/\">$18 billion in sales revenue every year</a> from abandoned carts. That’s a lot. But we also can’t manually retarget <em>every </em>abandoned cart, just like we couldn’t personalize the shopping experience for every customer <em>on our own</em>.</p><p>To hurdle this, eCommerce entrepreneurs can rely on marketing automations like email, SMS, or web push notifications to try and recapture a buyer’s interests. <a href=\"https://www.weblime.com/portfolio\">Weblime</a> uses this strategy for <a href=\"https://pawsbetweenhomes.org/\">Paws Between Homes</a> with a <a href=\"https://mailchimp.com/\">Mailchimp</a> integration where pet-lovers get email reminders to make or finish their online donation.</p><p>In the next section, you’ll see some more applications of email, SMS, and web notifications.</p><h3 id=\"more-applications-of-email-sms-automations\"><strong>More applications of Email &amp; SMS automations</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Invoicing</strong> – If you’re making multiple orders a day, manually designing each invoice is inefficient and tedious. You can use invoicing tools like <a href=\"https://www.quotemachine.com/en/invoices/\">QuoteMachine</a> to create personalized and on-brand invoices that also consider taxes and currencies. You can send them through automated emails triggered by a purchase.</li><li><strong>In-stock updates</strong> – let customers know when their favorite products are back-in-stock by their contact method of choice – be it through text, email, or even <a href=\"https://manychat.com/\">Facebook messenger</a>.</li><li><strong>Upselling/cross-selling</strong> – send your subscribers suggestions for higher-level or related products that they may like based on their previous purchase. This is a great way to really scrape the bottom of the barrel and maximize your eCommerce sales revenue.  </li></ul><h3 id=\"provide-real-time-customer-support-with-ai-powered-chatbots\">Provide real-time customer support with AI-powered chatbots</h3><p><a href=\"https://www.invespcro.com/blog/live-chat-customer-support/\">79% of customers prefer real-time customer support</a> because of the immediate responses – helping them convert faster (<a href=\"https://www.forrester.com/blogs/retailers-without-chat-a-missed-opportunity/\">40% conversion rate</a>). Furthermore, a happy live chat experience yields a <a href=\"https://www.forrester.com/blogs/retailers-without-chat-a-missed-opportunity/\">10% increase in average order value</a>.</p><p>But hiring around-the-clock customer support agents, training them, and scheduling shifts can be very costly and time-consuming. A practical solution to meet in the middle is an <a href=\"https://apps.shopify.com/tidio-chat\">automated </a>chatbot that can simulate a human-like conversation with ready responses to frequently asked questions. Just remember to remain available for bigger or more specific problems.</p><p>This isn’t just for customer service – you can even <strong>automate your replies to business reviews</strong> to show customers you care <em>and read </em>their opinions on your product or service. A <a href=\"https://zapier.com/apps/google-my-business/integrations/google-my-business/52845/respond-to-new-google-my-business-reviews-as-soon-as-theyre-submitted\">simple Zapier integration</a> can do this for you.</p><p>All in all, by automating most of your customer support and engagement (e.g. emails, SMS, &amp; Web notifs), you increase your own credibility, deliver a better user experience, and ultimately boost your eCommerce conversions.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://blog.weblime.com/content/images/2022/02/zapier-shopify-automations.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Some of the Shopify automations Zapier offers\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1173\" height=\"894\" srcset=\"https://blog.weblime.com/content/images/size/w600/2022/02/zapier-shopify-automations.png 600w, https://blog.weblime.com/content/images/size/w1000/2022/02/zapier-shopify-automations.png 1000w, https://blog.weblime.com/content/images/2022/02/zapier-shopify-automations.png 1173w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><h3 id=\"put-parts-of-your-operational-management-on-autopilot-shopify-flow-examples\">Put parts of your operational management on autopilot (Shopify flow examples)</h3><p>Think about all the specific operational tasks you might deal with on a day-to-day basis. With <a href=\"https://www.shopify.com/enterprise/flow-templates\">Shopify Flow</a>, you can start predicting and automating particular functions like:</p><ul><li><strong>Sending push notifications after customer’s second order</strong>. You can convert prospective customers into long-term buyers/community members with enticing offers or invitations that will only trigger after certain actions (like a second purchase, indicating strong interest in your company).</li><li><strong><strong><strong>Create a support ticket after a negative review. </strong></strong></strong>Received a not-so-stellar review? Show your customers that you don’t let these things go unnoticed with smart replies to each star rating.</li><li><strong><strong><strong>Segment customers by purchase behavior. </strong></strong></strong>As discussed in the benefits section, you can group customers based on certain behavior to send personalized marketing material and messages. So say a customer makes a purchase of over $200 on your Shopify store, you can tag them as “VIP” and dedicate special bundle offers or subscriptions just for them. Imagine all the possibilities with gender, age, or product-based targetting.</li><li><strong><strong><strong>Low-inventory. </strong></strong></strong>When you’re at hundreds of orders on a daily or weekly basis, it can be difficult to track your stock all the time. The last thing you want is an unhappy customer from a canceled order or delayed shipment because you didn’t know your product needs to be re-supplied.</li></ul><p>Automatically label a product as out-of-stock, implement a subscription form to notify potential buyers when the product is available again, and pause any related marketing material until things are back in business. Don’t archive the page. It can still be a valuable asset for garnering search traffic.</p><p>Depending on the business, your automations may vary too. In the scenario of one of our online service-based clients, Inspired Accounting, we set up a <a href=\"https://calendly.com/integration\">Calendly integration</a> to make it super easy for prospects to schedule a consultation.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://blog.weblime.com/content/images/2022/03/Calendly-Calendar-automation.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Calendly calendar automation displaying the user a choice of dates\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1553\" srcset=\"https://blog.weblime.com/content/images/size/w600/2022/03/Calendly-Calendar-automation.png 600w, https://blog.weblime.com/content/images/size/w1000/2022/03/Calendly-Calendar-automation.png 1000w, https://blog.weblime.com/content/images/size/w1600/2022/03/Calendly-Calendar-automation.png 1600w, https://blog.weblime.com/content/images/2022/03/Calendly-Calendar-automation.png 1920w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><h3 id=\"take-control-of-your-inventory-management\">Take control of your inventory management</h3><p>So compared to inventory logistics in brick-and-mortar retail stores, eCommerce inventory management is already miles easier in comparison. But that doesn’t mean online merchants can’t further streamline their online product stock tracking and management.</p><p>Right now, a lot of time is still spent keeping an eye on your store’s stock changes and manually tracking an extensive spreadsheet. But this is error-prone and still time-consuming in today’s sea of competitors leveraging automation. So a good solution would be automating bulk tasks.</p><p>eCommerce automation tools like <a href=\"https://www.zoho.com/ca/inventory/shopify-inventory-management-software/?network=g&amp;device=c&amp;keyword=shopify%20inventory%20management%20software&amp;campaignid=9821729655&amp;creative=430700712167&amp;matchtype=e&amp;adposition=&amp;placement=&amp;adgroup=101791934084&amp;targetid=kwd-333355106094&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiAgbiQBhAHEiwAuQ6BkkrHyU9unWMfTGuIiECzldFt5oD8l9rdBc6YGZCo4oWX-2w_WTonShoCIMoQAvD_BwE\">Zoho</a> take the spreadsheets out of your inventory management <em>and </em>give you forecast reports on product-demand, low-inventory updates, and an overall more comprehensive and insightful review of your total inventory.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"550px\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/yepWzFP_2D8\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe><!--kg-card-end: html--><h3 id=\"sell-products-competitively-with-data-backed-dynamic-shopify-price-automation-software\">Sell products competitively with data-backed &amp; dynamic Shopify price automation software</h3><p>Ever have difficulty pricing your eCommerce product?
