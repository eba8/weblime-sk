It’s not like starting a small business from scratch where it’s\neasier to gain traction from the start. With construction, you’re going up\nagainst people who have been in the industry for decades and are used to\nspecific ways of doing things.\n\nThat being said, digital marketing strategies such as search engine optimization\n(SEO) and pay-per-click (PPC) advertising are useful for putting your\nconstruction company ahead of the game. These strategies are proven to get you\nmore leads and help your business thrive!\n\nBut what’s great about these strategies is that they can be used in conjunction\nwith one another to create a well-rounded and effective marketing strategy for\nyour construction company.\n\nFor example, you can use your PPC ads to promote your website or social media\nprofiles. You can then use the content from those pages to create an email\nnewsletter.

Let’s get started!\n\nWhy is marketing important?\nFor years I've been sharing the power of marketing for construction companies,\nwhether it be on this blog or through one-on-one consulting. I've found that\nmany owners don't understand the benefits of marketing their business, or they\ndon't know how to market their business effectively. They end up making mistakes\nthat can cost them time and money and, even worse – miss out on new customers!\n\nWhether working in residential or commercial construction, learning how to\nmarket your business will help you attract more clients and win more work.\n\nWhen you market your business effectively, it builds brand awareness and\nperception of value for your products and services. The more people know about\nyour business, the higher the likelihood of gaining new customers.\n\nMarketing is a way to reach out to potential customers and current clients to\nkeep them engaged with your company. Marketing also shows that you believe in\nwhat you do, inspiring trust in your customers.\n\nIt's not just about telling people what you do, but how well you do it, why they\nneed it and who you are. Marketing includes everything from business cards to a\nfull-on marketing campaign. Marketing is essential because:\n\n * You can communicate more effectively with your customers.\n * It helps you build your brand identity.\n * It makes you stand out from the crowd.\n * It creates awareness for your business and its products or services.\n * It generates leads that will eventually turn into sales.\n\nConstruction marketing challenges\nIt is difficult for a new business to rise in the construction industry. It is\nespecially hard for small construction companies. These businesses have to face\ncompetitive challenges from giants which are well established in the market and\nhave strong marketing capability.\n\nThis means that good marketing is crucial for small businesses in the\nconstruction industry. You're competing for customers with large corporations,\nand it can be hard to get their attention when your brand isn't very memorable\nor distinctive.\n\nThat said, there are still great opportunities in this market because\nconstruction is a high-touch customer service business. Construction companies\nwill spend weeks renovating a single house and then sell it to the customer. So\nthey have lots more time than other types of companies to spend on things like\ncustomer service and building trust with customers.\n\nHere are the top five challenges that construction companies face when it comes\nto their marketing:\n\n 1. Marketing to real people who want to buy your products. That's not so hard.\n    You can advertise on the web and in print media for free, but you have to\n    make the ads relevant and compelling to actual customers.\n 2. Selling more than one service. That's a chicken-and-egg problem: how do you\n    get people to buy your services when they don't know they exist?\n 3. Building a website that is easy to use and attractive to prospective\n    customers. Designing is easy; actually building it isn't, especially if you\n    have no website development experience.\n 4. Getting your message across in an efficient way. You can hire a professional\n    designer cheaply or do it yourself if you have enough skill with HTML,\n    Photoshop, and other tools. But finding the right message can be more\n    complicated than it seems, especially if you're starting from scratch with a\n    brand new company.\n 5. Making sure that your website shows up high on Google searches for related\n    terms like \"construction services\" or \"construction company.\"\n\nGetting construction leads as a small business\nIf you want to generate more leads for your construction business, you first\nneed to understand your audience.\n\nFor example, if you wanted to sell a small home renovation service, you'd first\nhave to know who would be interested in buying it and where they will be\nlocated. Then after securing a few leads, you could ask them why they bought\nyour service. Was it because they saw an ad? A postcard? A friend? This\ninformation can help you with future marketing efforts and increase referrals.\n\nHowever, as a construction company in a large area, you need to do more than\njust sell building materials or even finished homes. You need to create a\nrelationship with the customer that lasts for years past the sale date so that\nwhen they are ready for another upgrade or addition (and this will happen\neventually), they call your company first!\n\nSome questions to ask yourself are:\n\n * What’s hot right now in construction?\n * What are people looking for when they look for a new home or building?\n * What is the current style?\n * How much are homes selling for right now?\n * How much are shopping centers selling for?\n * Are there any trends on either consumer or commercial construction?\n\nAn easy thing to do is simply Google “hot construction trends.” You’ll get a\nsense of what people are looking for in their homes and what they’re willing to\npay more for. If you take that information and use it in your marketing, you’ll\nstart to attract more leads.\n\nAnother great way to keep up with trends is to look at photos of houses with\nexteriors that have been painted recently. Find colors that seem prevalent in\nyour area, and then do some research to determine why homeowners choose those\ncolors. Is there a new architectural trend that’s driving their decisions? If\nso, how can you make sure your materials reflect that trend?\n\nYou can also keep up with what's new by following home design blogs for\ninspiration. Look for colors used together and find ways to incorporate them\ninto your work. If a particular style is gaining popularity in another part of\nthe country or world, consider adding it to your repertoire if it fits in with\nthe neighborhood you’re working in.\n\nBelow, we explore some of the top marketing strategies for your construction\ncompany.\n\nEncourage word of mouth\nOne of the most efficient marketing strategies for local construction businesses\nis word of mouth.\n\nThere are several ways that you can encourage word of mouth. The first is\nparticipating in meetups with your customers (if possible). For example, if you\nare a home builder, perhaps you can attend the neighborhood block party. If you\nare in commercial construction, maybe you can host a construction event for\nother companies with which you work.\n\nIf this isn't possible for the type of business that you run, there are other\nways that you can encourage word of mouth. You could consider joining BNI groups\nor participating in networking events. These are often filled with people who\nare looking for recommendations for great companies, and once they know about\nyour company, they will undoubtedly spread the word!\n\nAnother way to get more word-of-mouth referrals is to make it easier for your\nhappy customers to refer you by providing them with pre-written testimonials and\nsample tweets they can use on social media.\n\nYou can also offer discounts and rewards to people who refer your business. For\nexample, you might promise a $50 gift card to anyone who refers a new customer\nwho spends over $1,000 with you.\n\nDiversify your marketing channels\nResearch shows that consumers use at least ten different channels to find\nservices. It's not enough for a construction business to rely on traditional\nmarketing methods like print and TV ads or word of mouth to spread the word\nabout its services. Instead, owners need to diversify their marketing channels\nto stay competitive in today's digital world.\n\nFor example, if you only focus on SEO, you'll miss out on all the customers\nlooking for your services on social media or through word of mouth.\n\nIf you're just starting, it's important to choose marketing channels that are\nmost likely to give you a return on investment (ROI). This will help you make\nsure that your business is sustainable and profitable.\n\nThe best way to find out which channels work best for your business is by\nexperimenting with different options and measuring the results.\n\nFor example, if you run Facebook ads and get a lot of engagement from them, but\nno one hires you, Facebook isn't working for your business. You can try running\nads on another platform instead or investing more money in SEO. You can also\nhire a marketing consultant who specializes in construction businesses to help\nguide your strategy to be more effective.\n\nConstruction Business Ads\nPPC marketing for construction companies can help small business owners find new\nleads while increasing conversion rates and sales.\n\nSuppose you have a construction website with relevant content about remodeling\nprojects or the services you offer. In that case, it could be displayed as an ad\nin front of the people searching for what you are offering in your area.\n\nFor example, if someone searches for “remodel my kitchen” in Los Angeles, they\nwill see your ad if they are located close enough to your company and you have\nbid on that specific keyword phrase with Google AdWords.\n\nThe same principle applies to other forms of paid advertising like Facebook Ads\nor LinkedIn Ads, where you can target people based on their location, age,\ngender, and additional personal information they provide.\n\nUse Local SEO to your advantage\nA Google search for \"construction companies\" returns over 3 billion results. If\nyou're in the construction business, chances are your competitors are already\nranking high in search results and getting potential customers before they even\nreach you.\n\nIf you aren't already optimizing your website for local search\n[https://www.weblime.com/stories/how-to-promote-your-business-locally] results\n(or SEO), it's time to start. You don't have to be an SEO expert; just paying\nattention to the basics can significantly improve your website's ranking.\n\nAdd yourself to local directories such as Google My Business or Yelp so that\ncustomers can find you easily when looking for builders in their local area. By\nadding your business to these directories, you can also provide information such\nas opening times, contact information, and directions to your offices which\nmakes it easier for people to get in touch with you or visit you in person if\nthey need help with their home renovation.\n\nUse visual content on social media\nSocial media is an essential marketing tool for any business, big or small, and\nit’s no different for construction companies. Social media allows you to engage\nwith potential customers, promote your services and increase brand awareness of\nyour business overall.\n\nStart with one social media platform that you feel comfortable using (for\nexample, Facebook or LinkedIn) and build up from there.\n\nMake sure you add as much visual content as possible, showcasing your work by\ndisplaying before and after pictures.\n\nSet up email sequences for potential clients\nBusinesses that offer construction services are constantly struggling with\nfinding new customers. This is especially true for smaller businesses that don’t\nhave the resources to hire a marketing agency or invest thousands of dollars\ninto advertising campaigns.\n\nMany construction companies often forget that they might already have a solid\nemail list of potential clients, and they can start marketing to them before\nthey even reach out. This is what we call “email marketing,” and it can be one\nof the most effective ways to drive leads and sales for your business.\n\nIf you own a construction company, you can use email marketing to:\n\n 1. Promote your products or services. You can give your customers or prospects\n    information about any promotions you’re running or any new products or\n    services coming out soon.\n 2. Give industry news and advice. You can keep them up-to-date on what’s going\n    on in the construction industry and give them tips on how to get the most\n    from your products and services.\n 3. Get feedback from customers. You can ask for suggestions for new products or\n    services and encourage customers to leave reviews about their experience\n    with your business.\n\nOffer valuable information and be the go-to source\nAs a construction company, you can build trust with your customers by offering\nhelpful information and being the go-to source for construction projects. This\ncan often be done by creating content and sharing it on social media.\n\nOne way to do this is by creating an informative blog that provides useful\ninformation for your target audience. This can be anything from tips on hiring a\ncontractor to new technology in the industry and what trends are happening over\ntime in the market that your target customer is interested in.\n\nYou can also send out monthly newsletters with links back to your website or\nblog. These newsletters serve as a great way to keep in touch with customers and\nkeep them informed on what’s happening at your business. Ask them if there are\nany topics they’d like you to cover, and take advantage of this opportunity to\nanswer some of their questions.\n\nAsk for referrals\nOne efficient way to grow your construction business is through referrals. You\ncan get more referrals by doing any of these:\n\n 1. Referral cards - tell your customers to refer you to their friends.\n 2. Customer thank you notes - send your customers a handwritten thank you note\n    after every job to build a deeper relationship with them.\n 3. Business cards - give these out to anyone who may need your services in the\n    future.\n 4. Business profile brochure - showcase your company to potential customers.\n 5. Postcards - let everyone in your area know about your business and keep them\n    updated on new jobs you complete or offer specials for new customers.\n\nUse photos (Show off your construction projects!)\nIt is helpful to include various images that demonstrate different aspects of\nyour business. For example, if you are a kitchen renovator, you may want to\ninclude some before and after shots of your undertaken projects. If you are\nlooking to attract the attention of commercial clients, they will be impressed\nby your past successes as it gives them a flavor of what they can expect from\nyour service.\n\nIncluding images in your online portfolio allows potential new customers to\nlearn more about what you do and how you do it. It will enable them to see the\nquality of your craft and the professional approach that you offer. Customers\ncan judge whether or not they would like to use your service based on the\nevidence presented in front of them.\n\nCall past clients on a specific schedule\nDon't just welcome your new client on board when you sell something. You should\nalso constantly follow up with your previous clients.\n\nThe best way to follow up with your customers is to do so personally and\nconsistently.\n\nIf you have a large customer base, I highly recommend using an automated email\nmarketing platform such as Mailchimp or Keap to ensure that your customer\ncommunications are consistent and ongoing.\n\nCreate an authoritative website\nIf you haven’t already, you should create a website for your construction\nbusiness. A good website design is the simplest way to demonstrate your\nprofessionalism and values as a company.\n\nA professional-looking website will give customers confidence in your\nconstruction business and increase their likelihood of contacting you. If you\ndon’t want to create a complete website, at least get a landing page created\nwhere people can find out more about your business and contact you.\n\nA website is also a great place to start marketing your construction business.\nNot only is it a landing page that you can share with potential clients and\ncustomers (and provide to other websites), but it’s also an easy way to showcase\nyour construction projects, services, awards, and more. Plus, your website\nshould be built to drive lead generation so that you can easily capture contact\ninformation from interested visitors.\n\nConclusion\nMarketing is not as complicated as you may think. Just be aware of your goals\nand needs, then capitalize on your marketing opportunities for an effective way\nto reach those goals.\n\nThe Internet is a place that can help you in many ways—just make sure you treat\nit well because it will pay you back big time!","excerpt":"Construction businesses all want to get leads.
