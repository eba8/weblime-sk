The\\npower and flexibility of WordPress are simply amazing; no need to sugarcoat that\\nfact.\\n\\nHowever, if you’re looking for a way to extend the power and functionality of\\nWordPress, you might consider adding marketing automation tools.\\n\\nMarketing automation — using marketing tools like email and web analytics to\\nautomate tasks across your business -- has been around for ages. But what if you\\ncould integrate marketing automation into your existing WordPress site?\\n\\nDone right, a marketing automation campaign — a.k.a., a sequence of automated\\nmarketing tasks planned and executed to achieve specific business outcomes — is\\na well-oiled machine that kicks into gear the minute a visitor lands on your\\nsite.\\n\\nWhat is marketing automation, and why is it important?\\nMarketing automation is the use of software to automate marketing processes like\\nemail and social media. Advanced marketing automation software enables\\nbusinesses to streamline, automate, and measure marketing tasks and workflows to\\nincrease operational efficiency and grow revenue faster.\\n\\nMarketing automation includes tools such as email, social media scheduling,\\nsurveys, web personalization, and landing pages—tools that today’s consumers\\nleverage to witness the rise in popularity of digital channels.\\n\\nBut why do you need it?\\n\\nWell, suppose you’re a busy entrepreneur or business owner looking for ways to\\nscale your operations but don’t have time for manual data entry. In that case,\\nmarketing automation may be perfect for you.\\n\\nThe tools are easy to learn as well.\\n\\nFurthermore, many quality platforms offer free trials so you can see how they\\nfit your needs before making a purchase decision.\\n\\nHow using WordPress plugins for marketing automation can make your life easier\\nIf you use WordPress for your website and you’ve noticed that marketing\\nautomation can be a time-saver, lead generator, and help you stay organized,\\nthen using plugins for WordPress marketing automation can definitely work for\\nyou.\\n\\nThere are several benefits to automating your marketing with the help of\\nWordPress plugins. You’ll be able to see what works and what doesn’t in order to\\nincrease leads. Being able to analyze which content or what products have a\\nhigher conversion rate is very valuable information that can reduce your\\nworkload.\\n\\nAutomating your marketing efforts\\nIf you want to take your inbound marketing to the next level, then adding\\nHubSpot's WordPress plugin for tracking is a must. If you're one of the many\\nWordPress users out there who has a website made with WordPress and a HubSpot\\naccount, you can use this handy plugin to help you add more data about your\\nvisitors and follow up with them via email.\\n\\nHubSpot provides a plugin that allows you to integrate your HubSpot account with\\nyour WordPress site, so customers can enter their details directly into your\\nwebsite form, entering them into the lead nurturing and tracking funnel.\\n\\nThis is what HubSpot can help you with:\\n\\n * Easily add forms to your website: The HubSpot Marketing Plugin makes it\\n   simple to create, customize, and embed your own forms on posts and pages.\\n   Their drag-and-drop form builder allows you to tailor forms for any marketing\\n   need.\\n * Personalize the visitor experience: You can personalize every visitor's\\n   experience by using information from their contact records. Create smart\\n   lists based on specific criteria like contact attributes or behaviors, and\\n   use those lists in a content personalization tool to create unique\\n   experiences for contacts as they visit your site or blog.\\n * Learn more about how people interact with your site: The plugin’s analytics\\n   feature gives you access to page-level performance data within WordPress, so\\n   you don't have to leave the platform. Analyze trends across pages and posts,\\n   see which pages are most engaging, view referral traffic sources, and see\\n   which content generates the most leads within WordPress.\\n\\nUsing the Site Kit plugin for WordPress\\nFinally, a way to get the most out of your WordPress site without having to dig\\nthrough data and charts or spend hours poring over spreadsheets.\\n\\nSite Kit is an official plugin from Google that lets you access data from\\nmultiple sources (such as Google Analytics or Google Ads) directly from your\\nWordPress dashboard.\\n\\nWith this plugin, you'll be able to:\\n\\n * View your stats directly on your WordPress dashboard and make decisions based\\n   on that data;\\n * View stats from multiple Google tools such as Google Analytics or Google\\n   Search Console;\\n * Set up various Google tools without touching a single line of code;\\n * Track your desired KPIs for the entire website or specific pages only.\\n\\nSite Kit supports the following tools:\\n\\n 1. Google Analytics. You will be able to track the goals you set up for your\\n    users;\\n 2. Google Search Console. You will get access to Google search data and\\n    understand how Google displays your pages on the search engine. With this\\n    feature, you can also find out what keywords visitors used to land on your\\n    website;\\n 3. Google Tag Manager. Most business owners are reticent when it comes to\\n    installing tools and editing code on their websites. With this tool, you can\\n    now easily set up Google Tag Manager without having to change any line of\\n    code;\\n 4. Page Speed Insights. The tool will tell you what's holding your page back\\n    from loading faster, including recommendations for improving performance\\n    (like optimizing images or caching resources). You can even see how other\\n    sites have solved similar problems so that you don't have to reinvent the\\n    wheel every time!\\n 5. Google Optimize. Once you've got Site Kit installed on your site, you'll be\\n    able to set up Optimize and create tests in just a few minutes.\\n\\nUpon installing Site Kit, you just need to give it the necessary permissions and\\nverify your site ownership.\\n\\nUsing WooCommerce for your ecommerce site\\nWooCommerce is a free ecommerce plugin for WordPress, used by over 3 million\\nactive websites. In addition to being one of the most popular options for online\\nsellers, WooCommerce has many unique benefits.\\n\\nAmong these are its flexibility and customizability—it’s easy to integrate into\\nyour website and can be modified with a wide variety of extensions and themes.\\n\\nIn addition to its functionality, WooCommerce is also extremely easy to use—both\\nfor the store owner and their customers.

In this scenario, you might send them a welcome message\\nimmediately but then wait two days before sending another email with a\\nhyper-specific sales pitch.\\n\\nThere are lots of ways you can use drip emails in your business.

Your 9-5 (or maybe 6-11). You want nothing but the best\\nfor it. And part of that means choosing the right platform to set up shop.\\nNaturally, your decision comes down to the two industry titans: Amazon vs\\nShopify.\\n\\nWhile both eCommerce platforms allow third-party vendors to sell their products,\\nShopify and Amazon have some important distinctions that you need to consider\\nbefore launching your own eCommerce business.\\n\\nAt Weblime [https://www.weblime.com/], we're going to cover everything you need\\nto know about both with in-depth reviews so you can decide which ecommerce\\nplatform is best for you.\\n\\nShopify vs Amazon: Key differences\\n * While Shopify is a specialized ecommerce platform, Amazon is more of an\\n   online marketplace. On Shopify, you can build your own standalone online\\n   store from the ground up. But on Amazon, you're selling products on the\\n   Amazon marketplace, where millions of people shop already, alongside other\\n   third-party sellers. So while you need to build an audience for your Shopify\\n   store (a private entity), you're tapping into an audience with Amazon FBA (a\\n   public marketplace).\\n * Shopify is brand-centric, Amazon is Amazon-centric. On Shopify, you're\\n   building your own brand – a separate entity. That means investing in\\n   long-term digital marketing\\n   [https://www.weblime.com/stories/ultimate-guide-to-digital-marketing/] \\n   efforts on social media, search engines (SEO\\n   [https://www.embarque.io/post/global-seo]), and handling public relations.\\n   Customer service is also your responsibility and reflects on your brand\\n   image. But with Amazon, merchants give up most of the spotlight (branding,\\n   custom design, customer support) while they collect sales revenue behind the\\n   curtain.\\n * Shopify is more hands-on (lower costs), Amazon is more hands-off (higher\\n   costs). To build and operate your own online store using Shopify's ecommerce\\n   tools, \\n   [https://www.shopify.ca/pricing?term=shopify%20plans&adid=565729915161&campaignid=15436644442&branded_enterprise=1&BOID=brand&gclid=CjwKCAjwsJ6TBhAIEiwAfl4TWMnOHbcP09pf9RwKyAZPOjoJAc-38rmjIUOemp-avZ_mqcrythFKrhoCiqYQAvD_BwE&cmadid=516586854;cmadvertiserid=10730501;cmcampaignid=26990768;cmplacementid=324494812;cmcreativeid=163722649;cmsiteid=5500011]\\n   monthly subscriptions are available for different sized businesses. You'll\\n   need to find your own suppliers (through Aliexpress, Alibaba, or Zendrop,\\n   etc.), monitor product delivery, and handle customer service issues. With\\n   Amazon everything from product insurance, care, delivery, customer service,\\n   and overall management is taken care of. You just have to supply product\\n   media and copy, along with paying recurring costs like your selling plan,\\n   referral fees, fulfillment fees , and other expenses like long-term storage.\\n\\nWhat is Shopify?\\nShopify is a Canadian eCommerce company founded in 2006 by Tobias Lütke, Daniel\\nWeinand, and Scott Lake. Their bread and butter is pretty straightforward: an\\neCommerce platform for businesses of all sizes to create an online store. It's\\nused by some of the world's largest brands, including Tesla, General Electric,\\nBudweiser, Red Bull, and Nestle.\\n\\nShopify’s key features:\\n 1. A customizable platform: Shopify offers users a customizable platform to\\n    build their own online store. You can choose from a variety of Shopify\\n    themes or hire a professional team\\n    [https://www.weblime.com/stories/shopify-marketing-agency/] to add custom\\n    code to personalize the look and feel you want for your online store. And\\n    with the Shopify App store, you can add all sorts of nifty\\n    conversion-boosting features and functionalities.\\n 2. Wide range of integrations: Shopify's interface is designed to be\\n    easy-to-use because 99% of applications don't need technical experience,\\n    thanks to integrations. For example, with Google and Facebook, you can\\n    easily set up your traffic and audience engagement trackers (pixels), which\\n    normally involve coding knowledge. Other plugins can help you automate\\n    repetitive processes [https://www.weblime.com/stories/shopify-automation/].\\n 3. Integrated email marketing: With Shopify, you can send automated emails to\\n    your customers based on their interactions with your store. For example, you\\n    can set up an abandoned cart email campaign to recover lost sales, a\\n    customer retention email series to keep your customers engaged, and\\n    post-purchase emails to cross-sell or upsell products. All of these are\\n    customizable and require no coding knowledge.\\n 4. A built-in blog: Shopify has a built-in blogging feature that lets you\\n    easily create content to drive traffic and engage your customers. You can\\n    write blog posts, create product pages, and add other types of content to\\n    your store. And with Shopify's SEO features, you can optimize your content\\n    so that it ranks higher in search engines.\\n 5. Shopify payments: With Shopify Payments, you can accept credit cards and\\n    other forms of payment on your store without having to set up a third-party\\n    payment processor. Shopify Payments is available in the US, Canada, UK,\\n    Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, and Singapore.\\n\\nAlthough you can edit your store page and navigate rather intuitively on Amazon,\\nit simply doesn't offer the same suite of store and brand-building tools because\\nagain, Amazon isn't too focused on providing third-party merchants personal\\nbranding power.\\n\\nShopify Pricing\\nShopify offers 3 pricing plans:\\n\\n * Basic Shopify: $29/month (for new ecommerce businesses)\\n * Shopify: $79/month (best for growing businesses)\\n * Advanced Shopify: $299/month (best for scaling businesses)\\n\\nEach plan progressively offers lower credit card rates for cheaper payment\\nprocessing, larger shipping discounts, more staff accounts, advanced reports,\\ntax management, and international pricing tools.\\n\\nPros of Shopify\\n * Very intuitive to use. Shopify is one of the most user-friendly software\\n   applications out there. You can add products, customize your store pages, set\\n   up shipping and taxes, and more without having to touch a single line of\\n   code.\\n * Large variety of storefront themes. Online sellers can customize their stores\\n   any way they want with a wide range of both free and paid themes to choose\\n   from. And if you're not satisfied with any of the available themes, you can\\n   always hire a Shopify Expert to create a custom theme for you.\\n * Helps streamline your marketing and discounts. On Shopify, you can easily\\n   generate discount codes, create separate SEO headings and descriptions, send\\n   emails, and track your store's analytics all in one place. There are a ton of \\n   automation tools to help boost your sales too\\n   [https://www.weblime.com/stories/ecommerce-marketing-automation/].\\n * There's a Shopify app store (with a lot of apps). Some online businesses\\n   swear by particular apps that have single-handedly supercharged their sales.\\n   One example is SMS bump (text marketing). Shopify gives your online store\\n   access to thousands of unique apps that allow you to take your customer\\n   experience and business management to a new level.\\n * Fantastic customer support. One of the things that sets Shopify apart from\\n   other ecommerce platforms is its excellent customer support. Whenever you\\n   have a question or run into a problem, you can always contact Shopify's\\n   support team 24/7 via live chat, email, or phone.\\n\\nCons of Shopify\\n * Limited control over some aspects of your store. Because Shopify is a hosted\\n   platform, you can't make any changes to the server-side code or add custom\\n   plugins that haven't been approved by Shopify.\\n * Some plugins and apps can get costly in the long run. Alongside the monthly\\n   fee to Shopify, you may have to pay for a lot of the nifty tools that can\\n   elevate your shopper experience.\\n\\nAbout Amazon FBA\\nAmazon was founded in 1994 by Jeff Bezos. At first, it was an online bookstore,\\nbut it soon expanded to include all sorts of products, a to z. Now, they're the\\nlargest online retailer in the world and offer a wide range of services like\\necommerce, cloud computing, and digital streaming. They’re also known for their\\nexcellent customer service.\\n\\nHow does selling on Amazon work?\\nWhen you set up your Amazon Seller account, you'll need to provide some basic\\ninformation about your business, including your name, contact information, and\\ntype of business.\\n\\nOnce you're approved as an Amazon seller, you'll be able to create listings for\\nthe products you want to sell. You'll need to provide a title, product\\ndescription, price, and shipping information. You can also upload product\\nimages.\\n\\nWhen a customer buys one of your products, Amazon will notify you and ship the\\nitem to the customer on your behalf. You'll need to pay Amazon a fee for each\\nsale, as well as a monthly subscription fee.\\n\\nIf you're looking for an ecommerce platform that's easy to use and offers a wide\\nrange of features, Amazon is a good option. However, there are a few things to\\nkeep in mind before you start selling.\\n\\nAmazon FBA key features\\n 1. Product research tools. Amazon provides a few different tools to help you\\n    research which products are selling well and would be a good fit for your\\n    business.\\n 2. Automatic listing and repricing. Once you find a product that you want to\\n    sell, you can list it on Amazon with just a few clicks. Amazon will also\\n    automatically reprice your products based on competitor prices, so you don't\\n    have to worry about manually changing your prices.\\n 3. Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) program. Amazon offers fulfillment services to\\n    help you with the logistics of shipping and customer service. When you use\\n    FBA, Amazon will store your products in their warehouses and ship them to\\n    customers when they make a purchase. You'll also have access to Amazon's\\n    customer service team.\\n\\nAmazon Pricing\\nWhen it comes to selling on Amazon, your costs will depend on your\\n\\n * Selling plan [https://sell.amazon.com/pricing#selling-plans] ($0.99/units\\n   sold or $39.99 monthly)\\n * Referral fees [https://sell.amazon.com/pricing#referral-fees] (8-15% for\\n   using the Amazon brand to make sales)\\n * Fulfillment fees [https://sell.amazon.com/pricing#fulfillment-fees]\\n * Other costs [https://sell.amazon.com/pricing#other-costs] like long-term\\n   storage.\\n\\nOf course, with all those recurring fees, Amazon will glady handle the product\\ninsurance, care, delivery, customer service, and overall management. You just\\nneed HD product photos and videos, strong descriptions, and good review\\n[https://www.weblime.com/stories/how-to-add-reviews-on-shopify/]s.\\n\\nPros of selling on Amazon\\n * A lot of traffic already. When you sell on Amazon, you're selling on a site\\n   that already gets a ton of traffic. This means that there's a good chance\\n   that your products will be seen by potential customers.\\n * Familiar buying experience for customers. Customers are already familiar with\\n   the Amazon buying experience, so they'll know what to expect when they\\n   purchase from you.\\n * Low marketing costs. Because Amazon is already so popular and trusted, you\\n   won't have to spend as much on marketing and advertising to build that\\n   credibility.\\n * Super fast delivery. Unlike Shopify where your suppliers will likely use\\n   third-party delivery teams that could take anywhere between a week to month,\\n   FBA allows every product on your shelf to be delivered with same-day,\\n   one-day, or two-day shipping. Some metropolitan areas in the U.S. may even\\n   allow two hours!\\n * Unparalleled customer service. Amazon is known for its excellent customer\\n   service, so you can rest assured that your buyers will be taken care of if\\n   they have any questions or problems, without any extra involvment from you.\\n\\nCons of selling on Amazon\\n * You'll need to pay fees. Unlike Shopify, which has a monthly subscription\\n   fee, Amazon charges sellers a per-sale fee as well as a monthly subscription\\n   fee.\\n * You may need to invest in additional tools. While Amazon does provide some\\n   tools for sellers, you may need to invest in additional software to help you\\n   manage your inventory and shipping.\\n * There's a lot of competition. Because Amazon is such a popular platform,\\n   there's a lot of competition among sellers. This means that you'll need to\\n   work hard to make your listings stand out.\\n * Lack of control over storytelling and branding. On Amazon, your product\\n   listings will look very similar to everyone else's. For the most part, you're\\n   using pre-built formatting and design, so it can be difficult to tell your\\n   brand's story and build a strong connection with customers.\\n\\nThe verdict: Shopify or Amazon?\\nSo, which eCommerce platform is right for you? As you can see, it really depends\\non your needs and preferences. If you're looking for a trustworthy marketplace\\nto sell your goods with a more \\\"hands-off\\\" approach, Amazon is a good option.\\nHowever, if you want more control (CEO vibes) over your branding and\\nstorytelling, Shopify may be a better fit.\\n\\nNo matter which platform you choose, the most important thing is to start\\nbuilding your eCommerce business today.

The truth is—when you publish photos on different\\nplatforms like Instagram or Facebook, only a tiny percentage of viewers actually\\nsee them.

As well as helping you connect with other\\n   photographers, you can use blogging as a platform for sharing what you know\\n   about photography with others—and when they see how much value they're\\n   getting from reading what you write, they'll be more likely to want to come\\n   back for more!\\n\\nBest blogging platforms for photographers\\nWordPress is the most popular blogging platform for photographers. It offers a\\nhigh degree of flexibility, including the ability to customize your site's\\ndesign, add plugins, and integrate an online store.

Will it provide everything you need now and in the future?\\n * Branding – Does the platform allow complete control over your content and\\n   branding? If branding matters to you, then choose carefully. Some platforms\\n   add watermarks and links back to themselves and control what content goes on\\n   your site. Avoid these unless this is acceptable to you.\\n\\nYou now have a pretty good idea of what you should be looking for in a\\nphotography blog platform.\\n\\nThe most important thing to remember is that the perfect platform doesn't exist.\\nYou need to pick one that will allow you to focus on what's really important:\\nyour photography.\",\"excerpt\":\"We reviewed the top photography blog platforms on the market.

If your goal\\nis for people to contact you, it's not enough to just have a contact page or\\nform on your site; you have to tell them what to do with it and why they should\\nreach out.\\n\\nStart ABM (account-based marketing)\\nAccount-based marketing helps you target and engage the right audience and\\nconvert them into clients.\\n\\nHere are the significant benefits of ABM:\\n\\n * It’s personalized and targeted, so it delivers higher conversion rates;\\n * It’s faster than traditional marketing methods;\\n * It’s more efficient as it saves you both time and money;\\n * You can measure and track your performance metrics;\\n * Your team can work in unison as they have a common goal;\\n * You get better returns on investment (ROI) as your efforts are focused and\\n   not scattered.\\n\\nChoose a niche\\nA niche market is a group of people interested in a specific aspect of your\\nbusiness. A small homebuilder, for example, may choose to focus on building\\nluxury homes. Homebuilders then find out where potential customers in the niche\\nmarket live, the media they read, and the trade shows they attend and set up\\nbooths at these locations.\\n\\nMarketing your company to a niche market requires extensive research. For\\nexample, if you want to build luxury homes, you should research what makes a\\nhome luxurious. Is it: Use of special materials like granite? The number of\\nrooms? Expensive flooring? Large kitchen with top-of-the-line appliances? A wine\\ncellar?\\n\\nOnce you have determined what buyers in the niche market want, create a\\nmarketing plan that targets this group.\\n\\nCreate a blog\\nIf you’re a construction company and you blog about the most efficient way to\\nbuild a house, or some new technology in the industry, your audience will know\\nthat you are keeping up with the latest trends in your field.\\n\\nBut beyond that, your blog tells people what you think is important. Your posts\\nspeak volumes about your values and opinions. If you’re writing engaging\\ncontent, people will be reading what you have to say, and they will begin to\\ntrust your opinion. This can help you attract new clients who share similar\\nperspectives to yours.\\n\\nLeverage SEO (search engine optimization)\\nSEO helps you get found, and it's essential to make sure people can find your\\nbusiness online.\\n\\nTo illustrate, let's assume that two construction companies each have an\\nexcellent website with all their information clearly displayed, including their\\nphone number and email address. One company has invested time and money into\\ngood SEO, while the other hasn't bothered at all. Which one is going to get\\nfound first?\\n\\nThe higher up on the SERP (search engine results pages) you rank, the more\\nvisible you are to potential customers.\\n\\nSet up Google alerts\\nThe first step in getting your content to rank high on the search engines is to\\nknow what your customers are searching for.\\n\\nAnd you can find out exactly what they’re searching for with Google Alerts,\\nwhich allows you to monitor the web for interesting new content that has been\\npublished online.\\n\\nJust set up a list of keywords related to your construction business, and Google\\nwill send you an email every time something new shows up online associated with\\nthose keywords. That way, you can always be on top of what people are talking\\nabout related to your industry.\\n\\nOptimize for local search\\nIf you have a construction company that has a physical location, or even one\\nthat doesn't but serves a local market, then local SEO is for you.\\n\\nLocal SEO can help your site show up in relevant search results when customers\\ntype in location-specific keywords on sites like Google and Bing. For example,\\nif someone searches \\\"construction companies near me,\\\" Google will display their\\nbusinesses in the geographic area they specify.\\n\\nGet listed in directories and databases\\nMake sure your business is listed in the most popular search engines and\\ndirectories, including Google, Bing, and Yahoo!, along with other niche\\ndirectories specific to your industry.\\n\\nThis increases your chances of being seen by potential customers when they're\\nsearching online.\\n\\nAcquire more reviews\\nThe key to getting more reviews is to have your customers tell you their honest\\nopinion about your company. This may be difficult to do at first, but it is\\nessential to establishing trust within the community.\\n\\nA well-written review can attract new clients while keeping existing ones happy\\nwith their service or product.\\n\\nYou need both positive and negative feedback to grow as a business; otherwise,\\nhow will you ever know what needs improvement?\\n\\nStart getting backlinks\\nBacklinks are essentially links from other websites that point to yours.\\n\\nIf another website links to yours, web users must find value in your site.\\nConsequently, search engines place more value on websites with a good number of\\nquality backlinks. In simple terms, your content becomes more credible when\\nother websites link to it.\\n\\nUse multichannel marketing\\nMarketing channels are all about connecting with people.\\n\\nAs a construction company, you shouldn't rely on one channel only. The more\\noptions you choose, the more chances you have to meet new customers.\\n\\nBe present on social media\\nSocial media for construction companies is an important marketing tool that can\\nenhance your online presence and drive business growth. By having an online\\npresence on social media, you can connect with your target audience, show your\\nexpertise in the industry, share relevant content and engage with your\\ncustomers.\\n\\nThis is especially true for high-end projects, where homeowners invest thousands\\nof dollars in major home renovations or new construction projects. Homeowners\\nwant to make sure they hire a construction company with a good work ethic, does\\nquality work, has fair prices, and, most importantly, is trustworthy.\\n\\nRun direct mail campaigns\\nWhen was the last time you received a letter? A handwritten invitation to your\\nfriend's wedding, or a card from grandma? Nowadays, it's rare to receive a\\nletter in the mail.\\n\\nAnd that's what makes direct mail so effective. It breaks the clutter of digital\\nmedia, gets your brand noticed, and is the perfect match for something as\\ntangible as construction and architecture.\\n\\nUse videos to leverage your skills\\nOne of the best ways to promote your business is through video. It can help you\\ngenerate fresh leads, build your brand image and even increase sales. However,\\nmany small business owners think that video marketing is expensive and takes too\\nmuch time. This is why only a few companies use video marketing to promote their\\nproducts or services.\\n\\nBut, you don’t need to spend thousands of dollars on a professional videographer\\nor hire an agency to create videos for you. Most smartphones are capable of\\nshooting high-quality videos. Therefore, you can get started with video\\nmarketing with just your smartphone and a few basic tools.\\n\\nParticipate in expos\\nShowcasing your work at an exhibition or event will help you reach the target\\naudience faster.\\n\\nBut it is essential to choose the right kind of event for your target audience.\\nIf you are looking for potential investors, a property investor summit would be\\nmore suitable than a home buyer fair.\\n\\nA luxury housing summit would be ideal if you work in the luxury segment.\\n\\nOffer free estimates\\nConstruction companies should offer free estimates to their potential buyers.\\nFree estimates are a great way for customers to get an idea of their home\\nrenovation project's total cost and to make side-by-side comparisons of\\ndifferent contractors.\\n\\nTrack your phone calls\\nCall tracking is a technology that tracks the calls generated from website\\nvisitors through click-to-call buttons or call extensions in Google Ads. You can\\nuse call tracking to see which marketing channels generate the most calls and\\nhow many calls you receive from each channel.\\n\\nMost importantly, call tracking can help you run A/B tests on ad copy, landing\\npages, online forms, etc., to improve your calls-to-action to get more phone\\nleads.\\n\\nUse SMS marketing\\nText messages are one of the most convenient ways to get in touch with people.\\n\\nOne way to build your messaging list is through a signup form on your website.\\nYou can also request your customers and clients to opt-in while doing business\\nwith you.\\n\\nCreate referral programs\\nThe best way to cultivate relationships is through referral marketing software\\nwhich allows you to identify loyal customers and incentivize these users to\\nrefer other people to your products.\\n\\nFor instance, you can reward points for every construction project booked. In\\nthis case, the more projects booked, the higher the customer's membership level\\nbecomes. Then you can offer special benefits such as free upgrades or priority\\nservice when they reach certain tiers in the program.\\n\\nUse flyers\\nPrinted marketing materials aren't dead.\\n\\nSend your materials to relevant local businesses in your area. For example,\\nconsider sending your brochure to local cafes or restaurants if you're doing\\nlandscaping or gardening services. Not only will it give you exposure - if the\\nrestaurant has a lovely patio for outdoor dining, then your brochure is more\\nlikely to get attention from their customers!\\n\\nCreate an online portfolio\\nInstagram and Pinterest are two platforms that are very visual and will help you\\ngain more exposure.\\n\\nPost pictures of previous construction projects you've undertaken. Use relevant\\nhashtags when uploading your photos so other users can find them when searching\\nfor specific topics.\\n\\nFocus on retaining your customers\\nHere are seven ways you can create a customer retention program for your\\nconstruction business:\\n\\n * Don't be afraid to ask for feedback.\\n * Make it easy for clients to contact you.\\n * Thank clients for working with you.\\n * Celebrate milestones and anniversaries with your clients.\\n * Send out cards on holidays and birthdays.\\n * Just check in and don’t try to sell anything.\\n\\nJoin LinkedIn groups for construction professionals\\nConsider joining LinkedIn groups to connect with others in your industry, share\\nknowledge and insights, and build buzz for yourself and your company.\\n\\nJoin Facebook groups for homeowners\\nThese are the kinds of people already planning a renovation, but they may not be\\nready to call your company yet. By being part of their community, you get to\\nknow them better and share information about home improvements and remodeling\\nprojects.\\n\\nThis is a great way to get in front of your audience and start building\\nrelationships with them before they've decided to hire you.\\n\\nHost a webinar\\nThe construction industry has many topics that could be explored in a webinar\\nseries.\\n\\nIt's a great way to engage with potential customers in a very personal manner.\\nBy hosting this type of event, you can share your knowledge with others who may\\nnot be familiar with your industry.\\n\\nConsider donating\\nIf you work in the trades and have leftover building materials, donating them is\\na good way to get backlinks. As much as 30% of all building materials\\n[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123814753100154] \\ndelivered to a typical construction site can end up as waste.\\n\\nNot only will you make it easier for someone else, who is not so fortunate as\\nyourself, but you'll also be doing something good for the environment while\\ngetting some PR mileage out of it.\\n\\nNetwork with business owners\\nNetworking can be done in person or online. In-person networking includes\\nattending conferences, workshops, seminars, industry meetings, trade shows, and\\nother events that bring together people in your industry.\\n\\nOnline networking includes connecting with people on social media sites, such as\\nLinkedIn or Facebook, joining professional groups on these sites, joining online\\ndiscussion forums in your field, and following industry leaders on Twitter to\\nkeep up with their latest news and insights.\\n\\nLeverage testimonials\\nThere are a few different ways to get reviews:\\n\\n 1. You can ask for them directly. Just like you would ask for a testimonial or\\n    a case study, ask someone enjoying your product or service if they would be\\n    willing to leave a review for you.\\n 2. Ask for them indirectly. In other words, when someone does share feedback\\n    with you, ask them politely if they would mind leaving that same feedback on\\n    one of the various platforms that allow reviews.\\n 3. Make it easy for your customers and clients to leave reviews with direct\\n    links to the most popular review sites (Google, Amazon, Yelp, etc.). This is\\n    an excellent idea if you have an online store where people purchase products\\n    directly from you.\\n 4. Don't worry about negative reviews—just keep focusing on doing what's right\\n    for your customers and clients, and those positive reviews will follow!\\n\\nUse a CRM\\nConstruction companies can use information from a CRM system to market their\\nproducts and services to target customers.\\n\\nFor example, a company that builds new houses can use information from its CRM\\nsystem to market its services to customers who are buying a house for the first\\ntime.\\n\\nWork orders, customer preferences, and other data collected in the CRM system\\ncan be used to create targeted marketing campaigns that will likely appeal to\\ncustomers looking for specific construction services.\\n\\nUse Google Analytics\\nGoogle Analytics is an excellent tool for tracking not only who comes to your\\nwebsite but also where they come from, what they do once they're there, and how\\nlong they stay.\\n\\nHere’s why you should use it:\\n\\n * It's free!\\n * You can track almost anything you want (or need)\\n * Analytics are easy to understand\\n * Measure your website's social media impact\\n * Catch 404s and other broken links\\n * Lots of third-party support available\\n * You can see what people click on when they're on your site\\n\\nSet up paid ads on Google or Facebook\\nThe pay-per-click (PPC) model helps businesses spend only on the ads that\\nreceive clicks from potential customers without any extra charges for displaying\\nads. This model allows companies to save money compared to traditional\\nadvertising methods such as TV commercials and newspaper advertising.\\n\\nYou can choose to set up ads on any social media platform, but you should focus\\nmainly on Google or Facebook as a construction company.\\n\\nConsider expanding\\nThe US construction industry is highly fragmented, with many small companies and\\na handful of large firms. This makes it difficult to decide where to expand,\\nespecially since the high unemployment rate has hit the construction industry.\\n\\nCheck out some workforce statistics [https://www.bls.gov/iag/tgs/iag23.htm] and\\nanalyze which states have seen an increase in recent years. The best place to\\nexpand would be a state that has recently seen an increase in its construction\\nindustry, as indicated by an increase in its percentage of employment in\\nconstruction.\\n\\nConclusion\\nIt's no secret that proper marketing can grow your construction company\\nsignificantly.\\n\\nThe best way to implement these 35 ideas is by planning a marketing campaign and\\nworking on the goals more systematically.\\n\\nWhile doing so, you need to consider important metrics like cost per leads,\\nconversion rates and overall efficiency. If your campaign is successful and\\nleads are generated, you should be getting a good return on investment.\\n\\nThe options above give you plenty of good places to start!\",\"excerpt\":\"Build a Facebook or host a webinar.
