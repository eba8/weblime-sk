It can be a scary step, but it will feel more like a comfortable step into the future if you have the right tools, like the right blogging platform.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>You might not know how important it is to choose the right blogging platform for your photography business. The truth is—when you publish photos on different platforms like Instagram or Facebook, only a tiny percentage of viewers actually see them. And when viewers do see them, they’re often fed more, so it’s hard for them to keep up with everything you’ve done, which leaves them feeling disconnected from your work.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>A \u003Cstrong>blog\u003C/strong> is different from these other platforms because it is all about building an online presence on your website. Your \u003Ca href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog\\\">blog\u003C/a> will be constantly updated with new content to help your audience connect with what you have to share. The most successful bloggers post anywhere from 2-5 times a week and repost their previous posts to keep their content fresh and easily accessible. No matter how many times you repost, if you choose the right \u003Cstrong>platform for bloggers\u003C/strong>, people will always be able to find new content to maintain a connection and feel like they’re part of something.\u003C/p>\u003Ch3 id=\\\"benefits-of-a-photography-blog\\\">Benefits of a photography blog\u003C/h3>\u003Cp>The benefits of creating a blog for your photography business are infinite.

Here are just a few of the many reasons why you should start blogging:\u003C/p>\u003Cul>\u003Cli>Showcase your work and build an online portfolio. One of the best ways to get noticed is to have your work seen by as many people as possible—and with a blog, you can easily do that.\u003C/li>\u003Cli>Build your brand and gain exposure.

As well as helping you connect with other photographers, you can use blogging as a platform for sharing what you know about photography with others—and when they see how much value they're getting from reading what you write, they'll be more likely to want to come back for more!\u003C/li>\u003C/ul>\u003Ch3 id=\\\"best-blogging-platforms-for-photographers\\\">Best blogging platforms for photographers\u003C/h3>\u003Cp>WordPress is the most popular blogging platform for photographers.

There are two versions of WordPress:\u003C/p>\u003Cul>\u003Cli>WordPress.com—This version of WordPress gives you access to hundreds of free themes and thousands of free plugins. In its free starter plan, you also get unlimited storage space, which is ideal for photographers with large files that take up more storage space than text-heavy sites. However, it doesn’t offer a free custom domain name; instead, it provides a subdomain (yourblog.wordpress.com).\u003C/li>\u003Cli>WordPress.org—WordPress's self-hosted version allows you to host your blog on your server so you can customize anything without worrying about someone shutting down your blog.\u003C/li>\u003C/ul>\u003Cp>Check out our \u003Ca href=\\\"https://www.weblime.com/stories/the-ultimate-wordpress-guide\\\">WordPress guide\u003C/a> if you decide to go in this route.\u003C/p>\u003Ch3 id=\\\"ghost\\\">Ghost\u003C/h3>\u003Cp>Ghost is a blogging platform that has taken the world by storm.

Can the platform evolve with your changing needs? Does it allow plugins or themes that will help expand its capabilities? Will it provide everything you need now and in the future?\u003C/li>\u003Cli>Branding – Does the platform allow complete control over your content and branding? If branding matters to you, then choose carefully. Some platforms add watermarks and links back to themselves and control what content goes on your site. Avoid these unless this is acceptable to you.\u003C/li>\u003C/ul>\u003Cp>You now have a pretty good idea of what you should be looking for in a photography blog platform.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>The most important thing to remember is that the perfect platform doesn't exist.

A handwritten invitation to your friend's wedding, or a card from grandma? Nowadays, it's rare to receive a letter in the mail.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>And that's what makes direct mail so effective.

Because of this, CRM helps improve customer relations significantly by assisting companies in sending the right message to the right person at the right time.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Web Analytics Software\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Web Analytics is where you find data about how visitors interact with your website or online store. Tracking metrics like bounce rate, page views per visit, and time on site are essential for understanding which pages are working best and which ones need improvement. With data from web analytics software, you can calculate how well your campaigns are performing and how good your website’s UI/UX is.\u003C/p>\u003Ch3 id=\\\"best-ecommerce-automation-tools\\\">Best eCommerce Automation Tools\u003C/h3>\u003Cp>Now that you know the main categories of eCommerce marketing automation its time to have a closer look at some of the best tools out there.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Email Marketing Automation Tools\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\u003Cp>To recap, email marketing automation is a way to deliver emails to customers based on their behaviors. You can also segment users based on demographics, such as age, location, or behavior.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Some examples of email marketing automation include:\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Abandoned Cart Emails\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Many users tend to add a product to their carts and never really finish the checkout process. They might want to save their cart for later, but they simply forget about it in most cases.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Instead of losing these customers, you can set up an abandoned cart email campaign that will automatically send out a message reminding users about the products they never really purchased. This can help you increase sales for an extremely low cost, and it’s all automatic.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Cross-sell and Upsell Emails\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\u003Cp>After users purchase a product from your store, they will most likely receive a confirmation email. This is usually autogenerated by the \u003Cstrong>eCommerce platform\u003C/strong> you are using. But after they get this initial email, most people never hear back from the store they just purchased from.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>A cross-sell or upsell email campaign automatically sends out a message to your previous customers so they can come back and buy again. When you set up such a campaign, you want to make sure that you also include an incentive (like a discount coupon) so people will be more likely to reorder from your store.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Remember, previous customers are more likely to purchase from you than new users. This happens because they already trust your business and know that there is nothing to worry about.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Customer Engagement Emails\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\u003Cp>If your store allows users to create an account, you should have a bunch of useful information about them. Customer engagement emails are a great way to strengthen the relationship between your business and users by sending them a “Happy Birthday” message with a special discount.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Building this relationship will turn customers into brand advocates who will recommend your store to their friends and family.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Promotional Emails\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Say you have ordered a large quantity of a specific product because your supplier had a great offer. You now decide to run a campaign and apply a discount to that particular product or category.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>The best and cheapest way to boost your sales is to set up a promotional email campaign and let everyone on your list know about your offer.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>On the other hand, if your stock runs low on a product and you want to get rid of it to buy its new variant, you can send out a message to your list letting them know about it.\u003C/p>\u003Ch4 id=\\\"klaviyomost-accessible-email-marketing-automation-tool\\\">\u003Cstrong>\u003Ca href=\\\"https://www.klaviyo.com/\\\">Klaviyo\u003C/a> - most accessible email marketing automation tool\u003C/strong>\u003C/h4>\u003Cp>Klaviyo helps e‑commerce businesses collect, analyze and use customer data to optimize marketing strategies and maximize revenue.

They are not just numbers, but also a means to an end. They help you answer important questions about the current state of your business so you can make informed decisions. For example, a KPI could tell you if your ad campaigns are sending traffic to your website.

If the value is not measurable, it's difficult to analyze and compare it with other metrics. For example, \\\"readership\\\" is not a KPI because there's no obvious way to measure it. On the other hand, \\\"number of social shares of published posts\\\" is a good KPI because anyone can count the number of shares on Facebook or Twitter and compare it with previous months or years.\u003C/li>\u003Cli>\u003Cstrong>\u003Cstrong>\u003Cstrong>Quantifiable.\u003C/strong>\u003C/strong>\u003C/strong>\u003C/li>\u003Cli>\u003Cstrong>\u003Cstrong>\u003Cstrong>Actionable. \u003C/strong>\u003C/strong>\u003C/strong>The metric should tell you how customers behave on your website, so you know what actions to take to increase sales.

They're asking questions, getting answers, and ultimately deciding how much they're going to spend and when they're going to make their final decision.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>In every one of these stages, your website plays a leading role. Either it's helping you connect with potential buyers by answering their questions and providing value, or it's actively driving people away because it's not meeting their needs.\u003C/p>\u003Ch3 id=\\\"understanding-your-customers\\\">Understanding your customers\u003C/h3>\u003Cp>Who is your customer? What are their age and location? Are they male or female? What are their interests, hobbies, and pain points?

If you’re just starting, this may be a best guess based on the research you’ve done. If you’ve been in business for a while, look at your current customer base to determine what demographics they fall into. The more specific you get with your audience information – including psychographics – the easier it will be to understand what they want. \u003C/p>\u003Cp>For example:\u003C/p>\u003Cul>\u003Cli>A female-owned bakery will probably reach out to moms who are interested in kid-friendly recipes.\u003C/li>\u003Cli>A dog-walking service might target apartment renters who struggle to leave work early enough to walk their dogs before dark.\u003C/li>\u003Cli>A photographer might target couples planning weddings who want help capturing the memories.\u003C/li>\u003C/ul>\u003Cp>Once you have a clear picture of who your customer is, you can start to make adjustments to your marketing strategies and campaigns. If you’re collecting data on your customers, dig deep into categories like gender, age, location, income, and education. This information can help you make necessary changes to your marketing strategy so that it’s more effective in reaching those key demographics.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>The alternative is a manual process. You’ll need two teams: one focused on outreach and one focused on promotional content. The first team will be responsible for getting in touch with potential customers (i.e., creating a lead list) and scheduling meetings. The second team will be in charge of creating promotional materials like videos, blog posts, or infographics that showcase the features of your product or service in the most engaging way possible.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Each of these teams will have different goals based on the sales funnel stage they’re focusing on.\u003C/p>\u003Ch3 id=\\\"digital-marketing-channels-you-should-focus-on\\\">Digital marketing channels you should focus on\u003C/h3>\u003Ch3 id=\\\"search-engine-optimization-seo\\\">Search Engine Optimization (SEO)\u003C/h3>\u003Cp>Search engines use complex algorithms to rank websites and web pages based on several factors. The objective of SEO is to optimize a brand's website so that it appears higher in Google's organic results, the free, non-paid results. These unpaid listings are called organic results because they appear naturally at the top of a search engine results page (SERP) instead of paid ads that sit above organic results.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>If your site is new, you may benefit from \\\"technical SEO,\\\" which includes basic steps like adding alt text to images, fixing broken links, managing redirects, and so on.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>If you have an online store, you need \\\"local SEO.\\\" This involves claiming your Google My Business (GMB) page and optimizing it for relevant searches.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>If you're selling content marketing services (or anything else), you need \\\"content SEO.\\\" This means creating lots of high-quality content that people want to read and share.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>SEO is a relatively simple concept to grasp, but it is also somewhat complicated to execute because it involves so many moving parts. For example, Google's algorithm relies on over 200 factors when deciding where a page should rank in organic search results. To make matters worse, these ranking factors are constantly changing with each new algorithm update that Google rolls out.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>The best way to think about SEO is as a conversation between two parties - a brand and a consumer - conducted in an online setting. The brand's goal is to convince the consumer that it has precisely what they are looking for, while the consumer's goal is to find what they are searching for by quickly scanning the results of any given search query.\u003C/p>\u003Ch3 id=\\\"search-engine-marketing-sem-or-paid-ads\\\">Search Engine Marketing (SEM or Paid Ads)\u003C/h3>\u003Cp>Search ads are used for new customer acquisition and are a great way to find customers actively searching for products or services like yours.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>You can pay money to get your website listed on the first page of Google's search results. With paid search, you have more control over who sees your ad and where they see it, but it comes at a price. That price is based on a bidding system; whoever bids the most per click gets top placement in the search results. The bidding process works well for people who have a product or service that they know buyers are searching for; otherwise, you risk wasting money on clicks from people who aren’t interested in buying from you.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Because users type their own search terms, you can use keywords to get in front of specific audiences, rather than relying on audience segmentation and optimization algorithms. Additionally, search ads are typically cheaper per click than social media ads, making them more accessible to small businesses with limited ad budgets.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>In addition to finding new customers, you can also use search ads for retargeting audiences. Automation tools like Google Ads allow advertisers to target searchers based on previous actions they’ve taken on your site. For example, an advertiser could target a searcher who previously added items to their digital shopping cart but didn’t make a purchase with a special deal on the items left in their cart. Alternatively, you could target someone who abandoned their online form halfway through with an ad for the service or product they were interested in.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>If you’re feeling overwhelmed by the options, don’t worry—there’s nothing wrong with starting small and scaling as you go along. If you want to grow faster or try something new, you can always add in display advertising and video ads later on.\u003C/p>\u003Ch3 id=\\\"social-media-marketing\\\">Social Media Marketing\u003C/h3>\u003Cp>As a business owner, your goal should be to build a community of loyal, engaged followers. Social media is the perfect channel to achieve this goal because it allows you to interact with your customers online. Many people's followers on social media are some of their closest friends.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>To interact with your customers on social media, you need to know where they are and how they like to communicate. If you don’t already have an active social media presence, it’s time to start building one!\u003C/p>\u003Cp>For brands to get the most out of social media, they need to shift from sharing marketing messages to developing relationships with followers. Brands can do this by being human and engaging directly with users. For instance, some brands have used video posts to respond to customer inquiries or complaints rather than relying on written comments alone. This allows customers to put faces and voices to the people behind the brand.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>But which social media channel should your business use?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Platforms such as Facebook and Twitter encourage brands to use paid advertising to reach users who might not otherwise know about them. The potential downside is that these ads can be costly, especially if they aren’t well-targeted or are served to the wrong demographic.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>In addition to Facebook and Twitter, many brands also have a presence on Pinterest and TikTok aimed at younger users. The blend of video, images, and text on these sites makes them highly appealing for promoting products and services.\u003C/p>\u003Ch3 id=\\\"email-marketing\\\">Email Marketing\u003C/h3>\u003Cp>Email marketing is still the best digital channel for ROI and engaging with customers. Direct mail may have been the king of the marketing world once upon a time, but consumers now spend more time reading email than they do reading physical mail.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>And it's no secret that people love email. According to Hubspot, 78% of marketers have seen increased email engagement over the last 12 months.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Some email marketing forms have gone extinct with the rise of social media, but other forms simply adapt to our changing behaviors and needs. They morph into something new that reflects how we communicate and consume information today.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Some benefits of email marketing are:\u003C/p>\u003Cul>\u003Cli>\u003Cstrong>Engagement\u003C/strong>:  There’s a good chance your customers are using email and are eager to hear from you. An email is also a personal form of communication, which means it has a higher open rate than social media, blog posts, or paid ads—and it gives you more opportunities to build brand loyalty and engage with your target audience.\u003C/li>\u003Cli>\u003Cstrong>Brand awareness\u003C/strong>: When people think of your brand, you want them to think of consistency and helpful information that adds value to their lives. Email can help you accomplish this! You can build an engaged audience that looks forward to receiving your messages with email marketing. The more they interact with your content, the more likely they are to purchase from you in the future.\u003C/li>\u003Cli>\u003Cstrong>Conversions\u003C/strong>: Email marketing is one of the most effective channels for converting leads into customers. In fact, email generates $42 for every $1 spent.\u003C/li>\u003C/ul>\u003Ch3 id=\\\"influencer-marketing\\\">Influencer Marketing\u003C/h3>\u003Cp>As the influencer marketing landscape evolves, brands have an increasing number of options for selecting the right partners.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>In some cases, a high-profile celebrity may be the perfect fit — especially if they are genuinely interested in your brand and your product or service. But high profile celebrities aren't always the best influencers to work with.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>The same is true for micro-influencers. Just because someone has a significant following on Instagram doesn't mean they're an excellent fit for every brand.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>To find the right influencers for your brand, you need to understand your target audience and where they spend time online. From there, you can begin evaluating influencers and using data to decide who will drive the best results for your brand.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Picking the right influencer is essential. Your partnership needs to feel authentic. If a particular influencer doesn't align with your brand values, they become less effective as marketers and may even deter customers from engaging with your brand.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>To achieve ROI from influencer marketing without compromising brand integrity, marketers must select influencers who share the same values and style as their brands. Here are some things to consider when finding the right partner for your business:\u003C/p>\u003Col>\u003Cli>First, build a list of potential candidates by searching relevant hashtags and topics. Look for content creators who have already organically posted about your competitors — that is, they don’t look like ads.\u003C/li>\u003Cli>Next, use an analytics tool like \u003Ca href=\\\"https://klear.com/\\\">Klear\u003C/a> to find the most closely aligned influencers with your brand based on variables like audience demographics, engagement rates, follower growth, and location.\u003C/li>\u003C/ol>\u003Ch3 id=\\\"choosing-the-best-digital-marketing-strategy-for-your-business\\\">Choosing the best digital marketing strategy for your business\u003C/h3>\u003Cp>Digital marketing is based on strategy and planning. Simply throwing money at a website just because it looks nice will not help your business grow. The same goes for posting random social media content without having an overall strategy in mind.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>To be successful online, you need to create an effective digital marketing plan that will help you reach your goals and achieve results. More often than not, this is achieved through testing and reiterating your strategies until you find something that works and generates a positive ROI for your brand.\u003C/p>\",\"comment_id\":\"62049cb19d452f001cb5b439\",\"feature_image\":\"https://blog.weblime.com/content/images/2022/03/Guide-To-Digital-Marketing.png\",\"featured\":false,\"visibility\":\"public\",\"email_recipient_filter\":\"none\",\"created_at\":\"2022-02-10T00:03:45.000-05:00\",\"updated_at\":\"2022-03-07T16:03:37.000-05:00\",\"published_at\":\"2022-02-10T00:16:32.000-05:00\",\"custom_excerpt\":\"With so many approaches to digital marketing, it's hard to know which strategy to implement.

But why?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>How do reviews create trust? It’s hard to buy something when you don’t know what you are getting into. Reviews help reduce the perceived risk. A customer looking at a product on your Shopify store will estimate their risk in terms of the probability that they may have a bad experience.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>All things being equal, products with many customer reviews are seen as low-risk purchases, while products with few or no reviews are considered high-risk products.

Ideally, they should be Shopify partners and understand the platform's ins and outs.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>You should ask them about their previous work and brands they've grown.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>If you're considering hiring an agency that has never worked with an \u003Cstrong>ecommerce brand on Shopify\u003C/strong> before, ask them what their plans are for getting up to speed on the platform. They need to know how to use the built-in tools, and third-party apps to make design changes, set up retargeting ads, create customer segments, and automate personalized emails based on cart abandonment or purchase history.\u003C/p>\u003Ch3 id=\\\"what-does-a-marketing-agency-do\\\">What does a marketing agency do?\u003C/h3>\u003Cp>If you want to sell online, you need an intuitive and attractive website for your customers.

Let's face it: every business, no matter how big or small, can benefit from the insider information and knowledge that an industry specialist can provide.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Some agencies only work within specific niches. Collaborating with an agency in your industry gives you a competitive advantage over other brands. The agency will already know the ins and outs of your industry and has particular specialized expertise.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>You don’t have a marketing team.\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\u003Cp>If you are a small business, likely, you don’t have a marketing team yet.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>It would be wise to look for an agency that has experience working with ecommerce clients of your size. They’ll understand the challenges you face, and they’ll offer solutions that will benefit you.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>An agency will have developed its own proprietary software to manage campaigns and analyze data in many cases. You must ask which tools they use and how they will benefit your company. It’s also essential that they have a deep understanding of your industry so they can make recommendations about what would work best for you.\u003C/p>\u003Ch3 id=\\\"choosing-the-best-agency-for-your-shopify-store\\\">Choosing the best agency for your Shopify store\u003C/h3>\u003Cp>Before you lock yourself down into a committed relationship with a digital agency, take the time to check out your options and make sure that they have what it takes to make your time together an enjoyable experience.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>It's hard to know whether you will work well with an agency right off the bat. You've never worked with them before, so you don't know exactly how their process works or if it will match up with your needs. You don't know what kind of people they are and whether their communication style will be a good fit for yours.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>It's not easy to just take a leap of faith and hope for the best. That's why we recommend following the above steps when meeting with prospective agencies: Check them out thoroughly on their website, ask them questions that relate to your needs, ask to see work samples that are relevant to your project, make sure they understand your industry and goals, set up a meeting (or several) to get to know each other, and finally—trust your gut instinct!\u003C/p>\",\"comment_id\":\"6203df09f3c6a8001c140d0e\",\"feature_image\":\"https://blog.weblime.com/content/images/2022/03/shopify-marketing-agency.png\",\"featured\":false,\"visibility\":\"public\",\"email_recipient_filter\":\"none\",\"created_at\":\"2022-02-09T10:34:33.000-05:00\",\"updated_at\":\"2022-03-10T09:24:31.000-05:00\",\"published_at\":\"2022-02-09T10:36:33.000-05:00\",\"custom_excerpt\":\"Running a business is tough.

Our 6-month-old got it from his daycare (welcome to the world, Shai!), which continued to my wife and me. Our 4-year-old, somehow, survived the whirlwind and tested negative three times.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>And if we're being honest, would this even be a genuine 2021 review if it didn't mention Covid?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>The way 2022 opened up is a recap of 2021 in our household. Due to quarantines and covid scares, the kids were constantly in the house, creating an ever-challenging environment to get work done. Sometimes I have to dismiss all calls scheduled for the day, while other times, the house is silent, and I can execute and feel like I'm superman.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>I imagine this is more or less the new norm in family households and can only be thankful that through all the craziness, our family is safe and sound.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Establishing our foundation\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\u003Cp>In my \u003Ca href=\\\"https://www.weblime.com/stories/2020-year-in-review\\\">2020 year in review\u003C/a>, I covered much of what it took to get WebLime up and going. In 2021, as we progressed through opportunities and referrals started to come in, it was clear that my old ways weren't scalable. While we managed to hit some of the goals I laid out, we experienced painful growing pains.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>The goals I had for 2021:\u003C/p>\u003Cul>\u003Cli>Hire our first 2-3 full-time employees\u003C/li>\u003Cli>Publish 10 blog posts for WebLime\u003C/li>\u003Cli>Host at least 75 clients on DigitalAtar\u003C/li>\u003Cli>Adopt at least 5 more nonprofits\u003C/li>\u003C/ul>\u003Cp>Communication became tricky. My to-do list was no longer only mine, and as projects grew, clients expected more from us.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>If we wanted to handle a heavier workload, we would need to implement some structure to manage tasks and facilitate healthy collaboration. I had a lot of experience working with Asana in my previous job, so naturally, it felt right to go with them.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>For a few months, that did the trick, but as we grew and brought on more marketing clients, Asana began to choke on us. We needed to collaborate internally, upload the prepared material to social media platforms, and ultimately even share this with clients before anything went live.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>The marketing processes we formed internally became redundant. From preparation to approval and uploads - the work was limiting and hindering our creativity. We were too occupied with the operational aspect of getting things moving along.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>So after testing several solutions and doing extensive research, we finally settled for what seemed to be the perfect match. With Airtable, we're able to collaborate, execute, and even automate some of the ongoing tasks we did manually.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Now that this platform was in place, we could focus on actual work and not jump through operational hoops excessively.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Techincal focus\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\u003Cp>In 2021, we attempted to close every opportunity that came our way.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>The tech stack didn't matter, and the pricing wasn't ever a deal-breaker. We wanted to work, enrich our portfolio, and, most importantly, put ourselves out there.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>While doing this may have felt financially beneficial in the short term, I believe it's a strategic mistake in the long haul.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>The web development space is vast, and the solutions to building a website are abundant. Regardless of the direction you'll go, there are endless possibilities to consider.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>If you're thinking no-code solutions, the list of Wix, Square, Squarespace, and the likes doesn't end. And if you're thinking of raw code, the list of tech stacks and frameworks to choose from is also endless.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Choosing the right tech solution for a project requires intensive work and research. You have to understand who you're building for, the current needs, and where those needs might be in a few years of growth - it's no easy feat.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Assuming we reach a consensus with the prospect, agree on the approach, and sign a deal, we then have to dive head deep into the technicalities of the project.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>While offering this flexibility as a business is exhilarating and educational, it can also be exhausting and harm our clients. It means that we could be working with WordPress one month and another month with Square. One month we build a website for a restaurant, and the following month we work with clinicians.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>We did a great job at doing this. We've launched websites for restaurants, nonprofit organizations, lawyers, home improvement companies, and the list goes on.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>When you consider this dynamic, one must wonder, are we genuinely understanding the problems our prospects are presenting? And better yet, when we work with the chosen tech stack, are we executing with best practices?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Two of our clients were acquired in 2021. While I can't take any credit for that, I believe we assisted in having a presence online when their investors indulged with said brands.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>And while we may have executed in the best way possible in some cases, I believe we could have done far better or achieved faster results in others.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Cracking down on our approach is still a work in progress. On the one hand, I don't want only to serve one particular niche, and on the other, I want us to get really good at what we do.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>It seemed like a good starting point was to stick to a few tech stacks. Instead of bouncing around from Square to Weebly and then WordPress, we decided to focus on two solutions.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>WordPress &amp; Shopify\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\u003Cp>WordPress is an incredible platform.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>It's open-source, has gone through several decades of improvements and refinements, and is arguably the best CMS to use for any website, blog, or app. You can build with it just about anything you'd want. It offers over 50,000 plugins to choose from, and the list of WordPress benefits is extensive.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>But with all the perks and flexibility that WordPress offers, it can quickly become a vulnerability that leads to technological chaos.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Unfortunately, in most cases, when clients come to us with WordPress builds that have been worked on through the years, there's an overwhelming amount of plugins installed. Some plugins aren't supported anymore, others don't mesh well with the current selection of plugins, and some plugins shouldn't have been installed to begin with.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>This led me to two decisions in 2021:\u003C/p>\u003Cp>1) We'll use WordPress but not for every website. WordPress is at its best when you use several premium plugins and a few more. Around 10 is the magic number I try to stick to. After that, usually, things begin to get messy. I put together a \u003Ca href=\\\"https://www.weblime.com/stories/the-ultimate-wordpress-guide\\\">WordPress guide\u003C/a> covering this idea, and I intend to update it as WordPress matures.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>2) eCommerce builds on WordPress become tricky relatively quickly. While on the other hand, Shopify offers a robust eCommerce platform right out of the box. So we’ll stick with WordPress for general builds and Shopify for eCommerce.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>This new understanding meant that we could hone in on these technologies. It also meant saying no to opportunities that wouldn't be the best use of our time.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>If we learned what it takes to get a speedy and secure website running on the WordPress front, on Shopify, we knew which apps we found to be the best for enhancements and efficiencies.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>All of this meant we were more efficient with our time and becoming better at our craft. Eventually, this allowed us to execute better, charge more for our expertise and deliver better projects.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>The technical focus proved itself relatively quickly, but it happened only in the year's second half.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>We're now more agile, confident in what we deliver, and as a result, charge more. We went from closing $500 projects to bringing on projects above $10k. As we got more experience with WordPress and Shopify, our technical skillset advanced too.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>We're Shopify Partners, which opens many doors for us. And midway through the year, we were also accepted to be part of Storetasker's marketplace, which has been a great experience.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>As Shopify partners, we make a monthly commission off every store that we build and launch.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>And as we built these stores, we found ourselves falling in love with specific apps and tools more than others. So naturally, we applied for partnerships with those third-party services as well. The highlights there are ReCharge and Klaviyo. Both are superior in their areas, and generally, at least one is needed, if not both in every Shopify build.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Initially, it may not seem like a lot, but these small commission payouts from the various platforms and services will add and compound.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>With WordPress, we have a similar setup, only that we manage the technical aspects of the operation ourselves. With our project \u003Ca href=\\\"http://digitalatar.com/\\\">DigitalAtar\u003C/a>, clients can host WordPress sites, get business emails and buy domains.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>So we're now more efficient with our time, deliver more robust solutions to our clients and grow passive income as we bring in new deals.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Nonprofits\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\u003Cp>When I launched WebLime, I had no prior work to show my web development skills. It took some creativity to figure out how to break into the space and gain people's trust.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>After running circles with various networking attempts, cold calling and so forth, I found myself helping a nonprofit get on its feet. Within a few weeks, I got them up and running with a WordPress website, added a donation mechanism, integrated them with MailChimp for their newsletter and set them up for success with the operation.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Once it seemed like the org was smooth sailing, I reached out to the board, expressed my desire to continue supporting their online operations, and asked if they knew anyone else who could use this type of technical assistance.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>A referral came in for another nonprofit. Then another referral came in for a paid project. I crunched through the new projects on my plate and found myself getting more referrals from that.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>This process got me thinking about this reciprocal process.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Giving back to the community while growing DigitalAtar seemed like an extraordinary business formula.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Instead of launching nonprofits on GoDaddy and the likes, we can facilitate everything under our roof at DigitalAtar. It saves our clients from unreasonable fees and a lot of trouble and now nonprofits can enjoy this too.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Unlike our relationships with for-profit businesses, with the nonprofits, we’d offer a website build for free. Our only requirement is that hosting is done on DigitalAtar for $50 a month.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>This fee might come off as pricy, but when you digest everything that they receive, it's beneficial.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>The nonprofits don't have to scrap for free work and have random folks update their sites. They can expect it to get done professionally, on time, and as needed.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Meanwhile, WebLime can build on this business model and have the monthly fees collectively amount to something more lucrative in the long haul.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Marketing\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\u003Cp>As our marketing initiatives grew, it was clear that our clients got overwhelmed. It's challenging to run the operational aspect of a business. Now we were asking them to look at Google Search Console, traffic data, social media platforms, and so much more.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Again, we realized our approach wasn't scalable.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>We want our clients to have a general understanding of what we’re doing. We need them to review all this data. But they're so occupied with the operational day to day that getting them to log into so many other platforms didn't seem feasible. They didn't have the time or understanding of how the information correlates.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>There are a few ways to go about this obstacle. We could either develop an in-house solution or work with platforms that help you bring all the data together. This time we went with the latter.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>With our retainer model, clients who work with us on an ongoing basis now have an environment they can access at clients.weblime.com and view everything we do for them.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>They'll soon get monthly reports too.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Ironically, this didn't just improve our client's life but also ours. We now have all the data in one location, making it easier to digest and facilitate productive conversations.\u003C/p>\u003Ch3 id=\\\"digital-atar\\\">Digital Atar\u003C/h3>\u003Cp>DigitalAtar is a project we launched thanks to the insight we obtained from our clients. I covered the launch in my 2020 review and ended it with a goal for 2021 that we did not hit. I wanted us to reach 75 clients on the platform, and in hindsight, I understand this target was not realistic.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>We're not marketing the platform and are letting it grow organically. Meaning when a hosting opportunity arises for WebLime, those prospects end up opening an account at DigitalAtar. With the lack of focus I covered earlier, clients hosted the projects elsewhere in many cases. Sometimes, like Square or Shopify, it isn't possible to host anywhere but directly with them. While WebLime gets paid for the build, there isn't an opportunity for DigitalAtar.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>One of my goals in 2022 is to get DigitalAtar to a point where it doesn't merely help facilitate everything for WebLime's clients but also has clients of its own. That's when we could genuinely set goals for the project. Until then, it'll hinge on WebLime's pace of project completions.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>We did manage to improve the design of the platform drastically. It's more intuitive and more manageable for clients to navigate and get what they need.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>We updated the registrars we work with on the backend so that clients have more control over their DNS.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>The last big update worth mentioning is that we partnered with another company to improve our support. We have security and monitoring in place already, but it still felt like we should have a backup team. So, in addition to WebLime backing DigitalAtar, there is now an entire other company responsible for our servers and uptime.\u003C/p>\u003Ch3 id=\\\"the-construction-industry\\\">The construction industry\u003C/h3>\u003Cp>From a young age, any opportunity I had to work was answered by going to help my father with his handyman business. During the day, he worked for Home Depot and installed toilets or fixed leaks in the evenings or on weekends.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>By age 16, the business grew a bit, and the home improvement industry became second nature. I could install wood floors, plaster walls, and handle just about any aspect of the construction. Even if I didn't exactly know how to execute a task myself, I had a deep understanding of what needed to happen so that I could oversee the process and help manage it.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>With time the business grew, and my passion for technology pulled me away - but never too far. I may have worked for Geek Squad or taken on other roles outside the industry, but I always provided a technical anchor to the company.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>The business went from being a handyman service to becoming a full-blown home improvement operation that eventually my mom joined to help manage administration and sales.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>While helping our home improvement clients, I realized all my experience put me in a unique position. The industry hadn't advanced much. One company runs its operation with business cards, cell phones, and notepads, while another stumbled on a generic online management system and is trying to make it work.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>That's when I thought of HomePals.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Part of our marketing process requires helping clients get up and running with a contact management system, and in most cases, they're overwhelmed. It makes sense to solve this with an in-house solution.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>HomePals will begin by offering an easy-to-use management system and scale the idea from there. The end goal is to deliver a solution covering everything a home improvement company needs to operate smoothly.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Similar to our organic approach with DigitalAtar, the growth will parallel WebLime's pace of work.

So how do you determine if direct marketing is right for your contracting business? Let’s take a look at some of the best ways to market your contracting services directly from your website.\u003C/p>\u003Ch3 id=\\\"contractor-marketing-services-on-third-party-websites\\\">Contractor marketing services on third party websites\u003C/h3>\u003Cp>For homeowners who need to renovate their homes, finding the right contractor can be overwhelming. There are so many options out there, and it’s hard to know who to trust.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>HomeAdvisor, like many other platforms, is a website that matches homeowners with contractors for free. The company has been around since 1998 and has received plenty of press coverage over the years.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Third-party websites like HomeAdvisor and Angie's List are great for contractors because the services can be advertised directly to people looking for them.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Here are some aspects to take into consideration when listing your services on such platforms:\u003C/p>\u003Col>\u003Cli>Having your business listed is effective because customers can easily browse different listings and compare them. This opens up your business to many potential customers. If a customer searches for home renovation companies and you're not listed, they will likely pick another company. This also means that if a customer is looking at the reviews of several businesses, you might have lost them if yours isn't there in their list to choose from.\u003C/li>\u003Cli>If you are a new contracting business, getting your name out there is essential. You need to have a solid client base and have been in the business for several years before you can consider yourself established. However, because you’re new and don’t have a solid client base yet, being listed on platforms like HomeAdvisor or Angie's List can help you reach potential customers and get your business off the ground.\u003C/li>\u003Cli>These third-party websites are extremely easy to manage. You just need to set up an account and potential leads will start contacting you directly.\u003C/li>\u003C/ol>\u003Cp>This might all sound attractive, but there’s always a catch.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>In 2017, Angie’s List and HomeAdvisor have merged under the name of ANGI Homeservices Inc. This makes it harder for the industry and reduces competition.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Most leads are shuffled around and sold several times in many cases. The sources of leads are sold to other lead generators at high prices (many times over $100) and then resold again to consumers at a much lower cost. This leads to a high-profit margin for those selling the leads but sometimes at a huge loss to contractors.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>This huge loss translates into a lot of money being wasted on acquiring leads that are probably not a great fit either, as you need to pay a fee per each lead you acquire, even if it becomes a customer or not.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Therefore, it’s now more beneficial than ever to start marketing your services directly, while at the same time keeping your options open and still being listed on third-party websites.\u003C/p>\u003Ch3 id=\\\"direct-marketing-for-home-renovation-companies\\\">Direct marketing for home renovation companies\u003C/h3>\u003Cp>The digital marketing services industry is a growing sector for the home improvement industry. Growth in the area of digital marketing services is attributed to the continuing need for businesses, organizations, and individuals to reach a wider audience.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>The home improvement industry is always looking for ways to expand its customer base and grow its profits. One way it does this is by using \u003Ca href=\\\"https://www.weblime.com/stories/marketing-for-construction-companies/\\\">digital marketing services\u003C/a> specifically tailored to home renovation companies.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Digital marketing offers several advantages to those who use it. One advantage is that it helps them reach a larger audience than they could otherwise reach. This allows companies in the trades and home improvements industries to attract new customers from outside their immediate areas as well as from farther away.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>This can also help generate more sales for companies that are already established. Another advantage is that it allows them to reach existing customers more easily. It does this by providing opportunities for customers to find out about special deals through emails or social media sites.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Some benefits of direct marketing are:\u003C/p>\u003Col>\u003Cli>Building trust with your customers. In a world where consumers are looking for instant gratification, it’s important to make sure your company is visible online at the exact moment when a potential customer is looking for your services.\u003C/li>\u003Cli>Competing directly with other home improvement companies. The Internet has made it easier than ever to build and grow a business, but it's still a long road from developing an idea to establishing a profitable enterprise. That's why home remodeling companies that rely on digital marketing are more likely to survive.\u003C/li>\u003Cli>Reach measurable goals. One of the top benefits of using digital marketing services is that you’re always going to have multiple options when it comes to advertising your business. With digital marketing, you can keep all of your tools in one place and manage them from a central dashboard. This enables you to take advantage of numerous different forms of marketing all at once.\u003C/li>\u003C/ol>\u003Ch3 id=\\\"types-of-direct-marketing-for-contractors\\\">Types of direct marketing for contractors\u003C/h3>\u003Cp>\u003C/p>\u003Ch3 id=\\\"local-seo\\\">Local SEO\u003C/h3>\u003Cp>For a local home improvement company, local SEO is paramount and essentially refers to being present in the search result pages when people are browsing for your services on both desktop and mobile.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>This requires on-page and off-page optimization.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>The process includes making sure all of your information is up-to-date on all relevant local business listings, including Yelp, Google My Business, or Facebook. It also involves making sure the information on these sites is consistent with what is shown on your own website.\u003C/p>\u003Ch3 id=\\\"local-ppc\\\">Local PPC\u003C/h3>\u003Cp>Google Pay Per Click Marketing (PPC) is an effective marketing strategy that generates results in a matter of days.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Tailor-made for contractors, PPC is cost-effective because results are immediate. You pay for each click you generate.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>These are some points to consider when setting up your local PPC campaign:\u003C/p>\u003Col>\u003Cli>Choose your keywords wisely — this is the most crucial part of the process. You need to choose keywords that are relevant but will not be too competitive.\u003C/li>\u003Cli>Set a budget — the budget you set will determine what resources you have at your disposal during the campaign.\u003C/li>\u003Cli>Create an ad — the ad needs to be catchy and relevant to the keyword you’re targeting. Don't forget to include your business name, phone number, address, website link, and service area.\u003C/li>\u003Cli>Track your progress — Since PPC campaigns are real-time and results-oriented, you need to monitor constantly so that you can tweak your campaign as you go along.\u003C/li>\u003C/ol>\u003Ch3 id=\\\"social-media-marketing\\\">Social media marketing\u003C/h3>\u003Cp>As more and more users sign up for and use social media sites, your potential customer base is virtually limitless. And, since the core principle behind social media is networking, online networking can easily be done via these sites.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Social networks operate on the premise of word-of-mouth advertising in its most natural form. With status updates and tweets, users broadcast what they're doing, where they're going, and what they think in real-time. Their friends do the same thing, and their friends' friends do it too.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Without being intrusive or annoying, you can join in on these conversations as long as you contribute something of value to the conversation. You can also create your own conversations by sharing your own content with your potential customers and helping them with home improvement tips.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>You don't always have to sell outright; often simply engaging in small talk with potential customers about shared interests will build a rapport that will make them want to know more about you and what you have to offer.

A great eCommerce platform doesn’t just make it easier for you to create an aesthetically pleasing store—it can help you get more sales as well.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>At WebLime, we build eCommerce websites all the time.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>From what we’ve seen, the go-to choices are usually Wix, Squarespace, Shopify, and WordPress.

Well, the truth is that it depends. It depends on how complex you want your website to be and the resources you’re willing to invest into it.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Wix\u003C/strong> might be a great place to start if you're just getting started in the world of web design.

But they're not all right for every eCommerce site owner. So, how do you know which one fits you best?\u003C/p>\u003Ch3 id=\\\"what%E2%80%99s-the-best-ecommerce-platform-for-small-businesses\\\">What’s the best eCommerce platform for small businesses?\u003C/h3>\u003Cp>Small business owners usually pick Shopify because of its ease of use.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>At the same time, the only Shopify alternatives for building eCommerce websites are WordPress and BigCommerce.\u003C/p>\u003Ch3 id=\\\"wordpress-vs-shopify\\\">WordPress vs Shopify\u003C/h3>\u003Cp>The problem with WordPress is that it's not natively ready for eCommerce. For WordPress to support eCommerce, you'll need to install a few plugins. You'll usually start with WooCommerce and quickly find yourself adding more plugins to the standard options. And while we typically advocate for WordPress, we stay away from it when it comes to eCommerce.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Here's why:\u003C/p>\u003Cp>WordPress plugins are typically free, which makes them great for businesses just starting out. But that also means they're not tested or updated as often as those that charge a fee. That often leads to issues further down the road for small businesses in particular.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>There's not always enough support for the plugins, so you'll need to figure out your own tech issues. We had one client who couldn't get their WordPress store working until we suggested they try another platform entirely. It took one set up on Shopify to get them up and running, rather than days of frustration trying to get it working on WordPress.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>We decided against using WordPress for our eCommerce clients because we wanted something that didn't require constant updating and fixing - we wanted something that just worked!\u003C/p>\u003Cp>While WordPress is certainly capable, it's not the best option when it comes to eCommerce. While there are plenty of good reasons to stick with it otherwise, when you want your business to be online and selling products already, choose a platform specifically built for eCommerce instead of trying to learn WordPress and having to install a variety of plugins.\u003C/p>\u003Ch3 id=\\\"bigcommerce-vs-shopify\\\">BigCommerce vs Shopify\u003C/h3>\u003Cp>BigCommerce and Shopify are paving the way for the eCommerce economy. And while BigCommerce has its respect, Shopify is the true leader in the space.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>There are many factors to consider when choosing an eCommerce platform, such as pricing plans, features, integrations, and customer support. BigCommerce and Shopify are two of the most popular eCommerce platforms on the market today. Both have a lot to offer in terms of design flexibility, third-party integrations, and customer support. BigCommerce is known for its powerful back-end features while Shopify is known as one of the best eCommerce platforms for small businesses.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>If you want to build your eCommerce store from scratch, then Shopify is the obvious choice. But if you're looking for an enterprise solution and need a lot of support—BigCommerce might be a good fit for you. Both platforms are great for creating beautiful online stores with ease.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>So, if you're thinking about starting an online store, it's best to consider what you're looking for in terms of scalability and development options.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>For example, if you're looking for a platform that will grow with your business and allow you to customize your site however you want, Shopify is the better choice.  Shopify's editor is simple, more intuitive, and lets you work with content blocks.

But if you're a contractor who specializes in new homes or rooftop solar panels, for example, you can charge more for your services because those are more challenging projects with higher profit margins for the contractor.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>And when you have a track record of doing excellent work on difficult projects, then homeowners will be more inclined to hire you for the easier jobs.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Encourage Word of Mouth\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\u003Cp>A popular way of keeping customers happy is word-of-mouth advertising, the idea that your happiest customers will advertise for you by telling their friends about you. Customers who are really thrilled with your home remodeling services will refer you to others all on their own, without any prompting from you.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>The best way to encourage \u003Cstrong>word-of-mouth advertising\u003C/strong> is by doing a great job for your clients every time they do business with you. \u003C/p>\u003Cp>That means paying attention to details, being responsive, communicating clearly, and delivering what you promise promptly.

But as you grew, you soon found that these days face-to-face interactions don’t generate the number of leads that you need.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>In today’s digital age, most people find their contractors through online searches. This is where attracting good traffic comes into play.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Home Improvement Ads\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\u003Cp>One way to get it is by investing in pay-per-click (PPC) ads through Google AdWords, Bing Ads, or Facebook Ads.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>An efficient way to do this is to offer incentives, like a certain percentage of the total home improvement cost. Advertising incentives aren't only about sales. They're also about brand awareness and repeat traffic. When a customer sees a \u003Cstrong>home improvement ad\u003C/strong> that says, \\\"We'll match any competitor's price,\\\" they may or may not buy that day, but they do see your business' name. They have seen it, and it's likely to stay in their memory. That's brand awareness.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Advertising is also about repeat traffic. If a customer comes in for a specific sale item, like a total kitchen remodeling project, and goes home with something else as well, that's good for your business. They see the value of your business, and they're likely to come back when they need something else.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>The timing of the sale is important. You wouldn't want to run a \\\"Buy One Get One\\\" program for new patio furniture in December. It would be too late for summer parties. The best time to \u003Cstrong>advertise BOGO sales \u003C/strong>is around Labor Day when customers are thinking of what to buy for fall gatherings.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>It's worth taking the time to plan out your sale \u003Cstrong>advertising strategy\u003C/strong> so you can hit all three points: sales, brand awareness, and repeat traffic\u003C/p>\u003Cp>But the other way is by targeting people who are actively looking for what you have to offer. This essentially means running search engine optimization (SEO) campaigns.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>When a consumer is looking for a \u003Cstrong>service\u003C/strong> in your category, they usually google some keywords related to their needs.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Finding a company to do the job is easier than it has ever been thanks to the internet – especially if you have an online presence.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>However, the process of bringing \u003Cstrong>potential customers\u003C/strong> in could be quite difficult without the right strategy.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>With so many options available, it can be intimidating to figure out where to start when it comes to driving traffic to your home renovation business. But one of the most effective strategies is to utilize the tactics already made available to you.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>By using platforms that are familiar to homeowners, like your website, Facebook, and Twitter, you can bring in clients that may be more enthusiastic about the services you provide.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Use Local SEO to Your Advantage\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Local SEO involves optimizing your website to achieve a higher ranking when customers search for \u003Ca href=\\\"https://www.weblime.com/stories/construction-marketing/\\\">home renovation businesses\u003C/a> on Google.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>If your potential clients are searching for your services online, and they are likely to be in close geographic proximity to you, they can find you in their search results.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>That increases the likelihood that they will contact you and purchase your services.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>One of the most challenging SEO strategies is \u003Ca href=\\\"https://www.weblime.com/stories/local-seo-must-haves-for-any-website\\\">local SEO\u003C/a> because every city has different ways to rank a business or local website in their search engine.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>One area might favor linking root domains, whereas another area frowns upon it. Another region may prefer local citations, whereas another may prefer Facebook business pages instead.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Local SEO may seem like a daunting strategy at first, but once you see how it all comes together, it’s pretty easy to grasp. You need to take into consideration:\u003C/p>\u003Cul>\u003Cli>The need for \u003Cstrong>home renovation businesses\u003C/strong> around your area;\u003C/li>\u003Cli>The strength of your online presence such as reviews, your Google My Business profile, or location pages on your website;\u003C/li>\u003Cli>Your competition.\u003C/li>\u003C/ul>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Use Visual Content on Social Media\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\u003Cp>There is an SEO trend that isn't talked about much but can still have a big positive impact on your website's visibility in organic search results.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>That is - visual content.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Social media has made us all more visual-oriented and it's important for SEOs and businesses to catch up with this trend and find a way to make both social media and their website as visual as possible.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>And if you're good at the art of creating visual content (images, animated GIFs, memes, and so on), you'll be able to improve your local SEO performance at the same time!\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Visual content is at the heart of modern content marketing, and people love good visual content. In fact, businesses that use visual platforms are usually more likely to get shared, are viewed for longer, and are helped to convey their message better than a local business without visuals.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Visual content is a fickle beast, and sometimes you have to approach it in a different way than you would with text-based content in terms of strategic planning.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>While the overall goal of content marketing is still there - to build brand awareness and reach potential customers - subtle changes in emphasis are required to attract users to the words you post on visual media.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>But what should be your main platform for sharing visuals?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Pinterest has become one of the top networks for home renovation inspiration.\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\u003Cp>When the concept of Pinterest first started in 2010, it was mainly used as a platform to save ideas and style trends. But since then, more homeowners are using Pinterest to find home renovations ideas.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Not only that, it's being used as an online window shopping tool for homeowners who want to get ideas for renovation projects or find out how much something they found on the internet will cost to have done themselves.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>This poses a great opportunity to market your home remodeling business as an authority in the field. If you don't have a Pinterest profile, and you are starting a home remodeling business, it's not only time to create it - it's vital. Pinterest is a huge social media resource for interior design, decorating ideas, and renovation projects of all sorts.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Offer Valuable Information and Be The Go-To Source\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Creating valuable content is an essential part of both traditional SEO and local SEO.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>People love researching and finding out as much information as possible about the services they want to buy, before actually buying them. Information gives them a sense of security and control and comparing offers reduces friction in their minds.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>As home improvement professionals, you naturally want to be the best at what you do.\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\u003Cp>And just as in any industry, that takes a lot of specialization.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>However, increasingly it also takes something else: the ability to communicate with your clients. Content marketing is proving to be one of the best tools for doing this.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>It goes beyond simply blogging about topics and sharing information in hopes that it gets picked up. Rather, it is a strategy for building trust, cultivating loyalty, and getting new leads while moving prospects along the sales funnel.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Building your blog helps build your brand, as well as get website traffic to your homepage or service pages.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>It’s a whole lot easier to have people see your site when you have great content consistently flowing out from your blog.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>What does this mean for you? There is an opportunity there if you are willing to get started with content marketing for your remodeling business.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>So, what kind of content should you create? When it comes to content for your home remodeling business, you're going to want to look into all the options. By creating content in the forms of blog posts, videos and infographics, you will have a range of ways you can market your business.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>While blog posts are great, everybody does them. However, not enough businesses leverage videos to increase their traffic.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>When it comes to marketing tactics, video is one of the best ways to engage homeowners. People view videos more than any other type of content in a search engine.\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Videos can be used to market your home remodeling projects, build authority, establish your business as one that cares about its clients and communicate the uniqueness of your services.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>On the other hand, infographics are some of the most powerful tools for traffic generation and conversion optimization.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>They are not just about pretty pictures. Well-made infographics can be very useful to your readers as they visually display data, statistics, and even processes or procedures. This makes them ideal for marketing your business or project.\u003C/p>\u003Ch3 id=\\\"conclusion\\\">Conclusion\u003C/h3>\u003Cp>Marketing your remodeling business online is much harder than it used to be a few years ago.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Your competition is huge, and they are probably investing a bigger budget in their digital marketing efforts.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Make sure that you gain enough leverage across your chosen online mediums and that you invest heavily in local SEO.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Go through the options above, bring your marketing and sales department together, and build a roadmap that will bring results long term.

Over the years, these platforms have evolved to become the most sought-after software programs for bloggers and website owners. \u003C/p>\u003Cp>The use of Content Management Systems has simplified web development and allows users to intuitively edit and manage web content without having any prior technical knowledge.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Based on users’ opinions, these are the best content management systems available right now:\u003C/p>\u003Cul>\u003Cli>\u003Cstrong>WordPress\u003C/strong> - A powerful tool that has the \u003Ca href=\\\"https://www.weblime.com/stories/the-ultimate-wordpress-guide\\\">widest range of features\u003C/a>. It has a large community of designers and developers who can customize it to fit your needs. WordPress is also the most customized CMS with over 300,000 plugins, themes, and other tools available.\u003C/li>\u003Cli>\u003Cstrong>Joomla\u003C/strong> - Joomla is the second most popular CMS system after WordPress. It offers many of the same features as WordPress but with some differences in style. Joomla also offers more control over how the site looks with its own template engine.\u003C/li>\u003Cli>\u003Cstrong>Drupal\u003C/strong> - Drupal is similar to Joomla in that they both offer a lot of out-of-the-box features while also allowing customization through modules. Drupal however is one of the more complex CMS systems and requires some technical knowledge or a developer to get it up and running.\u003C/li>\u003C/ul>\u003Ch3 id=\\\"why-use-a-cms\\\">Why use a CMS\u003C/h3>\u003Cp>A major part of any website is how content is created and edited. This can be done through a blog or manually via FTP. However, if you have more than one person editing your site this can lead to some issues. And if you have multiple tasks then it could be time-consuming for each person to know where the other left off. \u003C/p>\u003Cp>All these problems can go away if you start using a CMS. Here are 10 reasons to use a content management system.\u003C/p>\u003Ch3 id=\\\"user-friendly\\\">User-friendly\u003C/h3>\u003Cp>You don’t need a degree in computer science to get started. Using a CMS is about the same as using a word processor or email program, and most people have had plenty of experience with those. \u003C/p>\u003Cp>By far the easiest to use CMS is WordPress. Its dashboard is extremely straight forward and absolutely anyone can figure out how to use it by themselves.\u003C/p>\u003Ch3 id=\\\"faster-installation\\\">Faster Installation\u003C/h3>\u003Cp>Content management systems have advanced so much lately that it will take you a few minutes to set up a new website, publish it on the web and start writing content.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Take \u003Ca href=\\\"https://www.easywp.com/\\\">EasyWP \u003C/a>for example, a service that will automatically create and publish your WordPress website in a matter of minutes.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Once you log in to your dashboard you can immediately start writing your first blog post and get it live on the internet.\u003C/p>\u003Ch3 id=\\\"no-coding-required\\\">No Coding Required\u003C/h3>\u003Cp>Once you have your CMS-powered website up and running you can customize every aspect of it using pre-built themes and plugins.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>WordPress features a library of more than 50,000 plugins and thousands of themes you can choose from. Installing any of them is a matter of a few clicks, which means you don’t even need to know what HTML is.\u003C/p>\u003Ch3 id=\\\"easy-to-customize\\\">Easy to Customize\u003C/h3>\u003Cp>Once you install and activate a theme you’ll be able to customize almost everything about your website.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Each theme has a central settings panel that allows you to edit your website’s details, like name, logo, and even the favicon icon (the small icon you see besides a website name in your browser’s tab).\u003C/p>\u003Ch3 id=\\\"improved-security\\\">Improved Security\u003C/h3>\u003Cp>A Content Management System (CMS) is a great way to ensure that your website is always up and running. If your site relies on a CMS, it is much easier to isolate and fix broken code than if it were a static site. This means that you can keep your site secure while making quick updates with ease.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Besides, depending on the platform of your choice you can always download extra security plugins. They make sure to keep your website free of attackers and bots using advanced functionalities.\u003C/p>\u003Ch3 id=\\\"simplified-collaboration\\\">Simplified Collaboration\u003C/h3>\u003Cp>Content management systems allow people to have access to your website and also collaborate on projects. Using individual accounts, multiple people can add, edit, or update content on the site right from their own computers or devices.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>You can create accounts for all your team members and assign them different roles such as editors, writers, or administrators. By doing this you make sure each person can only do a specific set of tasks.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>For example, a writer will not be able to publish content. On the other hand, an editor or administrator can.\u003C/p>\u003Ch3 id=\\\"streamline-scheduling\\\">Streamline scheduling\u003C/h3>\u003Cp>A CMS like WordPress makes it easy for multiple people to schedule posts to be published on your site. In fact, WordPress has made this process even easier since they added the feature a couple of years ago. \u003C/p>\u003Cp>The new version of WordPress allows you to schedule posts up to 12 months in advance. The scheduling function also works with categories and tags, as well as custom post types.\u003C/p>\u003Ch3 id=\\\"easy-content-updates\\\">Easy Content Updates\u003C/h3>\u003Cp>A content management system can save you time by letting you update articles, images, and other content directly from your dashboard.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>But that’s not all, if you decide to add a new page to your website you can easily update your main menu to include a link to it.\u003C/p>\u003Ch3 id=\\\"seo-ready\\\">SEO ready\u003C/h3>\u003Cp>A CMS, or content management system, is a tool for publishing your content online. Most of the major CMSs, such as WordPress and Drupal, are built with SEO in mind. This means you can add SEO features to your site without having to hire an SEO team.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Here are some of the tools you’ll find in most CMS:\u003C/p>\u003Cul>\u003Cli>\u003Cstrong>RSS feeds\u003C/strong>. RSS feeds allow search engines to pull in parts of your website automatically.\u003C/li>\u003Cli>\u003Cstrong>XML sitemap\u003C/strong>. An XML sitemap is a list of pages on your website that search engine bots can read and index. This helps them get a better idea of what’s on your site so they can provide better search results for users.\u003C/li>\u003Cli>\u003Cstrong>Robots.txt and .htaccess files\u003C/strong>. These are files that tell search engines how to crawl and index your site — what pages to crawl and how often, for example. This helps you control how much traffic goes to each page on your site, which is helpful if you want to build up certain pages or hide others from the public eye.\u003C/li>\u003Cli>\u003Cstrong>Titles and meta descriptions\u003C/strong>. When someone searches for something related to your business or industry, they’ll see the title and meta description you choose for each page on your website in the results\u003C/li>\u003C/ul>\u003Cp>It’s up to you how far you want to go down the SEO route, but you can always be sure that a CMS has you covered.\u003C/p>\u003Ch3 id=\\\"cost-effective\\\">Cost-effective\u003C/h3>\u003Cp>It is cheaper and quicker to invest in a content management system.

The higher you climb up the Google rankings, the more competitive your industry becomes. \u003C/p>\u003Cp>High rankings can be achieved in one of these ways: pay for ads or create great content and hope that Google likes it. \u003C/p>\u003Cp>Paying for ads is something small businesses may not be able to afford regularly, but if they can come up with an initial budget and make it work once, they will almost always get their money back.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Organic SEO is like building a real business; you need strong foundations and a strong team to build it well. If you don't have at least one expert in this area on your team, you need to hire someone who does—ideally before you start working on your website! \u003C/p>\u003Cp>However, if you have the budget for tools like Ahrefs or Semrush, you can start on your own.\u003C/p>\u003Ch3 id=\\\"semrush-for-keyword-research\\\">Semrush for keyword research\u003C/h3>\u003Cfigure class=\\\"kg-card kg-image-card\\\">\u003Cimg src=\\\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/gH9e3xYAYCRmdYathNZTFPkUiN27SRrXz375pdNfJI8mnVb2JMImxfOlGz6OqTruoVnLC53RLBVby3DU2Sf7ccDmmR6qP95nMPR5uglqK6ptraYT-twdih3z6QyzZpwNEw9EcNQf\\\" class=\\\"kg-image\\\" alt=\\\"SEM Rush Dashboard\\\" loading=\\\"lazy\\\">\u003C/figure>\u003Cp>Researching keywords and targeting them through your content is crucial for establishing yourself as a trusted authority in your niche.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>But if you are new to the SEO game, this initial process can seem overwhelming. \u003C/p>\u003Cp>The Semrush Keyword Research Tool is a great place to start since it has one of the largest databases of keywords available.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Semrush lets you easily find low-competition keywords that will help you rank faster.

These can be blog posts, infographics, videos, PDFs, and so on. \u003C/p>\u003Cp>But it's important to remember that Google doesn't rank websites based solely on the quality and relevance of the content itself; it also considers the authority of the website linking to that content.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Ahrefs has the second most active crawler in the industry. It collects the second-largest index of live backlinks (after Google) and probably the largest database of \\\"dead\\\" backlinks (the ones that are no longer pointing to the target site).\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Ahrefs shows you both DR and UR for your target URLs. These are separate metrics, but they are highly correlated, so you can use either one to roughly gauge the other.

This is not only a quick and easy way to improve organic reach, but it can also be very cost-effective.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>If you plan to pitch a certain website for a guest post, one of the first things you should do is check to see if that website has any broken links. If they do, ask if you can help them fix it by creating new content and replacing those links with yours.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>If you don’t have access to a tool like Ahrefs to check for broken backlinks, you could either acquire local citations or reach out to influencers.\u003C/p>\u003Ch3 id=\\\"how-to-get-visibility-for-your-local-business\\\">How to get visibility for your local business\u003C/h3>\u003Cp>For small local businesses, local citations have moved from being viewed as an unimportant ranking factor to one that many believe is critical in gaining top spots in local search rankings.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>A local citation is a reference to a specific business or location – often with accurate location information – that helps consumers find businesses on search engines and different platforms.  \u003C/p>\u003Cp>Besides having your information online, like address, phone number, and your company name, citation websites also help your customers check out reviews from other customers of yours. \u003C/p>\u003Cp>One good example is Yelp. Consumers are turning to online review sites for all their purchasing decisions, including vendors in the B2B space. An effective Yelp business page can prove effective in gaining new clients because many potential users are researching local businesses on the platform. \u003C/p>\u003Cp>Although there are other popular review sites available, Yelp has proven to provide great ROI for small businesses.\u003C/p>\u003Ch3 id=\\\"collaborating-with-influencers-on-social-media\\\">Collaborating with influencers on social media\u003C/h3>\u003Cp>Everybody knows that social media’s reach is only limited to the number of friends you have, but many other factors can determine how effective your campaign will be. \u003C/p>\u003Cp>All this points to one thing, social media marketing does not help businesses grow on their own. \u003C/p>\u003Cp>You need to be smart about it and devise a strategic approach to drive engagement and profitability. If not, you may as well just pay for ads instead of wasting time building your business on social media.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>You can create your social media accounts on sites like Facebook and Twitter, but some companies can help you market your products and services online at very reasonable rates. \u003C/p>\u003Cp>Advertising through social media channels is currently one of the most inexpensive and easiest ways of getting your products and services noticed by a large audience at once. At the same time, the word of mouth power of social media is potent and effective if done right.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>However, what most people overlook is the effectiveness of influencer marketing.

While the update only affected the top 10% of websites ranking in Google’s search engine results pages (SERPs), the impact was huge.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Websites with uncached content, based on certain criteria from Google, had their rankings plummet. In particular, homepages of “underperforming” websites took a significant hit.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>However, if you google “introduction to page speed”, the top result has an extremely low page speed score - 48 out of 100.

This is the case with WordPress websites the vast majority of the time, and this is due to poor choice of themes.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>There’s an easy fix - you can use a nice theme but then speed up your site load times with plugins that remove unnecessary content and compress it all down into something lightweight and fast.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>At the same time, make sure you choose a good WordPress theme and customize it yourself.

Compressing a picture means taking a larger file and shrinking it down to a smaller size.

You will notice that when you use the same ratio when shrinking the image to a different size, the image is still perfectly fine.\u003C/li>\u003Cli>Only upload JPG images.

Both of those updates were algorithm changes that dropped websites from rankings due to mobile usability issues.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Core Web Vitals, along with other features Google has said they are exploring for inclusion in future search results, are the next step in Google’s movement towards ranking websites based on their user experience instead of just using link metrics or keyword placements.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Google’s core search results are a mixed bag of user experience and link metrics. The Core Web Vitals signal is an even more direct approach to measuring user experience and how it relates to a website’s authority. How does Google define ‘good UX’ in this context? And how can you optimize for it?\u003C/p>\u003Ch3 id=\\\"why-is-google-doing-this\\\">Why is Google Doing This?\u003C/h3>\u003Cp>The web has evolved over the last ten years, and Google has adjusted its ranking algorithm accordingly. In the beginning, links were the most significant factor in determining a website’s authority. As time went on, however, other factors like website load time and mobile-friendliness became important as well.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Now, with the announcement of Core Web Vitals, Google is taking things one step further by directly measuring the quality of a website’s user experience instead of just factoring it into their algorithm as a secondary signal.\u003C/p>\u003Ch3 id=\\\"what-are-the-three-core-web-vitals\\\">What are the three Core Web Vitals?\u003C/h3>\u003Cp>Google's Vitals take a real look at the usability and accessibility of a web page.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>The Largest Contentful Paint value looks at the difference between the first paint of a page and the point where you can't scroll anymore.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>FID looks at how long it takes from when a user has clicked a link until they see something on the screen.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>CLS looks at whether or not users will understand what to do on a page without zooming in.\u003C/p>\u003Ch3 id=\\\"largest-contentful-paintlcp\\\">Largest Contentful Paint - LCP\u003C/h3>\u003Cp>Largest Contentful Paint is the measurement of how long it takes for Googlebot to see the \\\"largest\\\" piece of content on your page.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>It then calculates this time in relation to the total loading time of that page.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>The more text or images have to be loaded, the higher the paint time will be due to the additional bytes coming from these elements.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Measuring the largest contentful paint time (LCP) for your site can help you track performance, identify pain points, and prioritize improvements. Matching the LCP on your website to that of your competitors' websites will also tell you what visitors expect from you.\u003C/p>\u003Ch3 id=\\\"first-input-delayfid\\\">First Input Delay - FID\u003C/h3>\u003Cp>First input delay (FID) is a term used to describe the time from when a user first interacts with a website to when the browser is able to respond to that interaction.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>This metric can be most frequently used in testing with JavaScript-powered controls but is also an issue for mobile sites, where it can also be caused by mobile redirects.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>First input delay is one of the only real-user performance metrics that directly relate to user experience.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>While metrics like page load time, visual completeness, and download time all have a hand in ensuring that a page is visually complete when a user interacts with it, if a page isn’t able to respond to inputs at or near the same time as they are made, it will feel slow and laggy.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>When it comes to the user experience, the perception of speed is arguably the largest contributing factor. The more quickly your site feels, the more likely users are to stay on your site. This is why measuring First Input Delay (FID) is so important. A recent study suggests that reducing FID can lead to an \u003Ca href=\\\"https://rockcontent.com/blog/first-input-delay/\\\">increase in conversions\u003C/a> for some sites.\u003C/p>\u003Ch3 id=\\\"cumulative-layout-shiftcls\\\">Cumulative Layout Shift - CLS\u003C/h3>\u003Cp>Cumulative layout shift (CLS) is a term that encompasses all of the various unexpected things that can happen to a website that cause elements on the page to shift around.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>More often, I’ve seen this happen with images, but it can occur with anything. The most common places I see this are on homepage sliders, 3rd party call-to-action buttons, title tags, contact forms, and the social media buttons at the bottom of sites.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>The longer it takes to load a webpage, the higher the chances of the site visitor leaving the page and going somewhere else.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>So you can understand why a sudden shift of a website element could be a nightmare for your conversions rate if not adequately handled. The proper solution is not just minimizing CLS or eliminating it, but understanding what types of elements have caused shifts and if possible how to fix these issues.\u003C/p>\u003Ch3 id=\\\"how-do-i-pass-core-web-vitals\\\">How do I pass Core Web Vitals?\u003C/h3>\u003Cp>The Core Web Vitals assessment is part of Google's Mobile-Friendly Test.

However, you can still give yourself an advantage over this competition by starting to market more effectively through various channels. \u003C/p>\u003Cp>This leads us to ask the question - what are the 10 most effective ways to get \u003Cstrong>construction leads\u003C/strong>?\u003C/p>\u003Ch3 id=\\\"build-a-more-attractive-website\\\">Build a more attractive website\u003C/h3>\u003Cp>Your website is your selling tool that conveys a message to clients and captures their attention. For your site to engage your customers, it has to be visually appealing and easy to use. \u003C/p>\u003Cp>Moreover, your site has to be optimized for conversions, making it the perfect place where customers take the next steps towards conversion.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Make sure that your website includes the following:\u003C/p>\u003Cul>\u003Cli>Clear call-to-action elements that persuade people to contact you;\u003C/li>\u003Cli>A “Contact Us” page detailing your location.

It’s not about what you are doing, but rather who you are connecting with. \u003C/p>\u003Cp>Social media has made it easier than ever to find and communicate with customers who may be potential \u003Cstrong>leads for construction companies\u003C/strong>.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>You can use these social media accounts to publicize your services and promote your construction business. The trick here is that you don’t want to post everywhere and anywhere and appear like a spammer even though your target audience is big. \u003C/p>\u003Cp>At the same time, you need to find a way to tap into all the different social media networks available today.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>For example, some of your customers might be active on Pinterest, searching for inspiration on how to remodel their homes.

PPC marketing for home renovation can help small business owners find new leads while increasing conversion rates and sales.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>In the past decade, PPC has taken off as a viable tactic to create awareness of your construction business across a variety of popular search terms. \u003C/p>\u003Cp>When people search for a contractor using a popular keyword, Google generates an “ad” based on what it thinks you may be interested in reading or viewing.

The first goal is to build rankings that help your site rank high in the top 10 “organic” listings of Google’s search engine results pages (SERPs) for keywords relevant to your business.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>The second goal is to drive traffic to your site to make sales or generate leads.\u003C/p>\u003Ch3 id=\\\"build-local-authority\\\">Build local authority\u003C/h3>\u003Cp>The objective of local SEO is to increase your presence in your local neighborhood. \u003C/p>\u003Cp>You do this through Google Maps, Facebook, Twitter, business directory websites, etc. Put another way, an online presence that focuses on your location rather than your business name. \u003C/p>\u003Cp>This way customers will be able to find you when searching for specific keywords in the local area (i.e. \\\"construction in Vegas\\\").\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Focus on the following:\u003C/p>\u003Cul>\u003Cli>Optimize your Google maps listing;\u003C/li>\u003Cli>Be consistent across platforms by providing the same business name, address, and phone number;\u003C/li>\u003Cli>Generate more reviews both on Google maps and on your website;\u003C/li>\u003Cli>Create local citations.\u003C/li>\u003C/ul>\u003Ch3 id=\\\"acquire-local-citations\\\">Acquire local citations\u003C/h3>\u003Cp>Your online reputation and rankings are not just limited to what comes up when someone searches your website URL. \u003C/p>\u003Cp>Local citations or mentions of your business name include any online mention of your business's name, address, and phone number. \u003C/p>\u003Cp>These can be listings on local business directories such as Yelp, Yellowpages.com, Whitepages.com, and Local.com as well as Facebook pages, Twitter accounts, and blog posts that include business names and location information.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Even though local citations are purely online mentions of your business's name, address, and phone number; they still hold a lot of weight in terms of rankings.\u003C/p>\u003Cfigure class=\\\"kg-card kg-image-card\\\">\u003Cimg src=\\\"https://res-4.cloudinary.com/hsmap5mlr/image/upload/q_auto/v1/ghost-blog-images/hubspot-crm-overview.png\\\" class=\\\"kg-image\\\" alt=\\\"Get More Home Improvement Customers - CRM HubSpot overview\\\" loading=\\\"lazy\\\" width=\\\"1024\\\" height=\\\"640\\\">\u003C/figure>\u003Ch3 id=\\\"sign-up-for-a-crm\\\">Sign up for a CRM\u003C/h3>\u003Cp>Customer relationship management (CRM) is a fancy way of saying that a business needs to keep track of the health and status of its relationships with customers and prospects. \u003C/p>\u003Cp>A CRM system allows you to accomplish this and helps you stay connected and streamline processes.

This will be perfect for more casual home renovations where you only want to send out letters once or twice a year to customers, friends of customers, and new leads. \u003C/p>\u003Cp>If you’re doing larger home renovations or more commercial jobs, you’ll need to hire someone to do direct-mail campaigns on your behalf.\u003C/p>\u003Ch3 id=\\\"generate-monthly-reports\\\">Generate monthly reports\u003C/h3>\u003Cp>As much as it’s important to create a long-lasting online marketing strategy for your construction business, it’s equally important to track the return of investment on these channels. \u003C/p>\u003Cp>One sure way of doing that is to create automatic monthly reports of all your expenses and the profit you have generated from each channel.

However, business owners can rest easy knowing that they can win over their audience with simple engagement techniques.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Many businesses have capitalized on this technological transformation; however, several businesses continue to think that online marketing is akin to their traditional marketing. \u003C/p>\u003Cp>The fact is that technology has revolutionized online consumer behaviour and the presence of consumers on the internet. Staying ahead of your competition depends on how you embrace modern marketing trends.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Now, you are probably thinking, “of course my business needs to stay relevant in this day and age”. But what does being relevant mean for local businesses in 2021?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>This article will highlight the five main local strategies that I have followed for my local agency, WebLime. It includes tips you can use to drive engagement with your customers.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>It is not enough to provide high-quality products and services today, businesses need to also think about running local marketing campaigns like building citations, leveraging their network, creating a Google My Business profile, or collaborating with non-profits.\u003C/p>\u003Ch2 id=\\\"the-power-of-local-networks\\\">The Power of Local Networks\u003C/h2>\u003Cp>It’s easy to ignore marketing yourself as a small business because you don’t have the time to dedicate to it. But if you don’t invest in yourself, how will anyone know about your business? You can’t expect sales to roll in if you aren’t putting in the time to make them happen.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Small business networking is one of the best ways to learn from other entrepreneurs and gain more customers. It’s not very difficult to participate in, but you do have to take the initiative. \u003C/p>\u003Cp>There are two ways to meet other small business owners: in person or online. I find that online networking is much easier to manage, especially if you’re not looking for a partnership or co-branded products.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>How can networking benefit you? You might hear about a great service provider offering a special rate or have the chance to partner with another business to expand your own. Both of these situations could save you time and provide a much better ROI than if you tried to do everything on your own.\u003C/p>\u003Ch3 id=\\\"meet-people-online\\\">Meet People Online\u003C/h3>\u003Cp>Whether it’s Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, or YouTube, there are various ways small business owners can connect. \u003C/p>\u003Cp>In today’s world of social media, we don’t always have to meet someone in person to be friendly with them.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Just because you are a small business owner doesn’t mean you can’t get involved online with other entrepreneurs. The truth is that successful entrepreneurs learn from others who have been successful.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>One great strategy is to find local businesses online and promote them. This is a business-to-business (B2B) strategy that should be used to find connections with other companies that can help increase your sales and awareness. \u003C/p>\u003Cp>As you make these connections, always let them know up front what it is you do. For example, if you are a Maryland-based printing business, create a list of potential companies in that industry to reach out to and partner with.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Everything is one Zoom away!\u003C/p>\u003Cp>However, if you are an offline-meetings fan, you can always network and create a partnership over a coffee. Join a coworking space and chat with folks around you. Chances are, you will meet like-minded people that might need your services or can refer you to their friends.\u003C/p>\u003Ch3 id=\\\"join-networking-groups\\\">Join Networking Groups\u003C/h3>\u003Cp>Business networking is one of the most productive ways to generate referrals and leads. \u003C/p>\u003Cp>It’s also a rewarding way to increase your return on investment through stronger relationships with customers and prospects. And it helps contribute to the overall growth of your business through its many benefits.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>One of the most beneficial things you can do for your business is to interact with other business owners, and learn how they are getting the word out about their business. \u003C/p>\u003Cp>It’s a great opportunity to ask them questions and learn from their experience. You will not only develop more networking contacts, but your business will grow as well.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>I’ve found that there are no shortcuts to building such networks. \u003C/p>\u003Cp>But the network you start today is likely to be considerably different from a year or two down the line because it will grow as you do. If you’re not getting out and meeting people in person, your opportunities for developing valuable relationships will dry up. \u003C/p>\u003Cp>How do you find networking groups and associations to join? \u003C/p>\u003Cp>The best way is to get out of your home or office and talk to local business owners. Make friendly small talk about how their businesses are doing. Ask them if they know of any profitable business networking groups in the area. If they give you a blank look, then ask which business group or association they belong to and contact the organization for information on further groups.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Sometimes your local Chamber of Commerce provides a great vehicle for this kind of networking.\u003C/p>\u003Ch3 id=\\\"be-active-on-social-media\\\">Be Active on Social Media\u003C/h3>\u003Cp>Social Media is an amazing tool for local businesses and small business owners. It provides the means through which you can show off your skills, but also convey personality and be vulnerable in front of people.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Customers tend to trust genuine people first, then businesses.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Consider picking one platform to get started with, and try to build relationships and chat with people. You can also choose to target a very specific audience. \u003C/p>\u003Cp>If you’re building websites, you might have more luck targeting small business owners in Maryland, than targeting the worldwide population.\u003C/p>\u003Ch2 id=\\\"meetups-are-still-huge\\\">Meetups Are Still Huge\u003C/h2>\u003Cp>Since Covid, a lot of meetups are happening online.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>However, now that things are starting to settle down, you should start considering joining meetups in your local area. \u003C/p>\u003Cp>The type of event I’m talking about is often marketed to people who are either looking to start their own business or improve their life in some way. \u003C/p>\u003Cp>Now, whether you're struggling to find the perfect job or you’re just getting started with entrepreneurship, these are the kinds of events that are attracting thousands of people every week and helping them meet new people and launch new businesses.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>If you are not familiar with meetups, it may be tempting to dismiss them as yet another fad. \u003C/p>\u003Cp>But, although they have been around for decades, most of the meetups that are currently providing opportunities for personal development are making a bigger impact on the world than ever before; and their influence continues to be felt in new and interesting ways. \u003C/p>\u003Cp>Many of today’s top entrepreneurs attribute much of their success to the courses that they took or the groups that they joined while participating in meetup groups when they were starting.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Whether you are looking to network with people who have similar interests to you, improve your social skills and confidence or get help starting a business, you will be able to find a meetup group that fits in perfectly with your lifestyle and learning goals.\u003C/p>\u003Ch2 id=\\\"google-my-business-the-king-of-local-seo\\\">Google My Business - The King of Local SEO\u003C/h2>\u003Cp>If you are a local business and don’t have a Google My Business account, you’re missing out and lending your online real estate to someone else.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Business owners who want to use the potential of the internet to reach new customers or promote their brand should set up a Google My Business listing.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Business owners can create and manage their business listings on Google My Business, and Google has made the process as simple as possible. Once you’ve set up your listing, Google My Business will appear as a panel in Google search results. It will display contact information and a link to your website and show ratings and reviews for your business.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>The benefit of having a Google My Business page is that you will not only show on the map in search results but also appear in the Knowledge Graph if you have more than one location. This gives users an accurate idea as to what your business looks like, your set hours, and when it’s most convenient for them to visit.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Once you’ve set up your Google My Business account and claimed your listing, it’s time to get optimizing. \u003C/p>\u003Cp>There are several elements you can include in your GMB listing. The main thing to remember is that there are fields you must fill in, including a phone number, physical address, opening hours, and website URL. Spaces can be used for additional information.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>You should aim for as much relevant information as possible as Google says this helps them evaluate relevance. The more relevant information you add to your GMB listing the higher it will rank in Google for your search terms.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>However, you should not forget about reviews.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Improving your business online often starts with how you’re viewed by local customers. This goes beyond just providing directions to your location and instead includes other aspects of your company such as whether or not customers can leave a review on Google or Yelp about your company. \u003C/p>\u003Cp>If a customer is searching for a company that provides services in your area, they may be much more likely to choose to do business with you because they have read good reviews about you versus your competitor.\u003C/p>\u003Ch2 id=\\\"build-citations-to-build-credibility\\\">Build Citations to Build Credibility\u003C/h2>\u003Cp>Besides a Google My Business account, citations are a must if you are a local business looking to acquire more customers.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Local citations are online mentions of your business name, location, and phone number, and other information that might be relevant to your potential customers.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>A citation isn’t limited to just any mention of the local business. The information about the business must be verifiable and be local. Simply including the business name in a quote or mention does not count as a citation.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Contrary to popular belief, citations are not simply the business cards of the online world. Citations are web pages that come up in search engine results when your business name or address is searched and they contain that information. They can be found on every platform, from social networks to local directories to review sites.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Accurate citations carry the most weight in the validation of a business’ information.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>When Google looks at local businesses, they evaluate whether or not the data they’re collecting is accurate. If it is, then a business’ information will be more trustworthy and the listings for that business are more likely to show up in SERPs. \u003C/p>\u003Cp>Local SEO may seem complicated from an end-user perspective, but the reality is that it’s relatively straightforward for businesses. \u003C/p>\u003Cp>For businesses with reliable local citations, the natural result is a positive impact on search engine results.

In this form, you can put an entire website or app together without touching any code. And even more so, it can be up with the latest trends and requirements; SEO Friendly, Security, Responsiveness, and so much more.\u003C/p>\u003Ch3 id=\\\"the-problem\\\">The problem\u003C/h3>\u003Cp>WordPress matured as a platform on a fundamental premise of openness and flexibility. \u003C/p>\u003Cp>Sounds great, right?

This open concept can present not only functional problems but, more importantly, security vulnerabilities.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>If you're just getting started with WordPress, you can quickly find yourself feeling overwhelmed. As of this writing, the official marketplace for WordPress plugins has over 55 thousand options.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>My intention isn't to knock the platform at all. \u003C/p>\u003Cp>I've launched dozens of WordPress websites and developed some opinions about the platform. Learned what I like and what I don't. Each build made the next one more manageable and better. My goal is to share some of the processes and plugins I've found useful.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>I'll treat this guide as the resource I wish I had when starting a digital agency.\u003C/p>\u003Ch3 id=\\\"the-solution\\\">The solution\u003C/h3>\u003Cp>My most important rule of thumb to WordPress is not to install more than ten plugins.

You want your site to \u003Ca href=\\\"https://www.weblime.com/stories/how-fast-should-a-website-load/\\\">load blazing fast\u003C/a>, be bug-free and secure. So, try to hold back and question yourself before you install yet another plugin.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>How do you limit WordPress to 10 plugins? \u003C/p>\u003Cp>Build, test, and repeat.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>At WebLime, we review WordPress builds for our clients all the time. Something that strikes out the most is WordPress installations having more than 25 plugins. I've even seen sites with more than 50 plugins installed and active!\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Generally, the premium plugins allow you to achieve more. Instead of loading four plugins to achieve four features, you load one plugin that'll cover your needs.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Also, and you may be surprised to read this in a WordPress guide, but don't swear by WordPress at all costs. \u003C/p>\u003Cp>Sometimes WordPress is not the ultimate solution. \u003C/p>\u003Cp>Since adopting my ten plugin rule, I've had to consider new technologies and approaches for clients.

Each tool can tell you something different and each gives you more insight into what needs fixing.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Some great tools for auditing your website are Ahrefs, ScreamingFrog, or SEMRush. It’s important to understand that a technical SEO audit will not tell you why your website’s rankings are dropping, but it will serve as a foundation of understanding which aspects of your website to change in order to make improvements.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Generally, technical SEO audits include website performance recommendations and page-level optimizations.

Anchor texts are one of the most important aspects of off-page SEO. These texts are displayed on each link to your website and draw the visitors’ attention.

It launches every time the website loads and follows along as you browse more internal pages on a given domain.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>With the pixel's origin being foreign, this raises a lot of issues.

And with that magic comes a heavy-weight price tag, from either direction you measure it.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>In America, no policy close to Europe's GDPR survived the political battleground. The closest we've gotten is interrogating our top CEOs publicly on the big screens. And that's not a knock at it at all.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>I believe we've managed to shift the public's perspective on this burning matter. Companies and their CEOs are constantly being questioned and tasked to make the wrong right.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>The problem is the money is too good when you adopt these tactics.

This is done for both websites via Safari and mobile apps via the App store.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Unfortunately, the public is currently reliant on private organizations for data protection.

With construction, you’re going up against people who have been in the industry for decades and are used to specific ways of doing things.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>That being said, digital marketing strategies such as search engine optimization (SEO) and pay-per-click (PPC) advertising are useful for putting your construction company ahead of the game. These strategies are proven to get you more leads and help your business thrive!\u003C/p>\u003Cp>But what’s great about these strategies is that they can be used in conjunction with one another to create a well-rounded and effective marketing strategy for your construction company.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>For example, you can use your PPC ads to promote your website or social media profiles. You can then use the content from those pages to create an email newsletter. These are just a few examples of how different strategies can work together to produce leads and grow your construction company.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>A solid marketing strategy for your construction company means more exposure, awareness, and leads.

I've found that many owners don't understand the benefits of marketing their business, or they don't know how to market their business effectively. They end up making mistakes that can cost them time and money and, even worse – miss out on new customers!\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Whether working in residential or commercial construction, learning how to market your business will help you attract more clients and win more work.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>When you market your business effectively, it builds brand awareness and perception of value for your products and services. The more people know about your business, the higher the likelihood of gaining new customers.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Marketing is a way to reach out to potential customers and current clients to keep them engaged with your company. Marketing also shows that you believe in what you do, inspiring trust in your customers.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>It's not just about telling people what you do, but how well you do it, why they need it and who you are. Marketing includes everything from business cards to a full-on marketing campaign. Marketing is essential because:\u003C/p>\u003Cul>\u003Cli>You can communicate more effectively with your customers.\u003C/li>\u003Cli>It helps you build your brand identity.\u003C/li>\u003Cli>It makes you stand out from the crowd.\u003C/li>\u003Cli>It creates awareness for your business and its products or services.\u003C/li>\u003Cli>It generates leads that will eventually turn into sales.\u003C/li>\u003C/ul>\u003Ch3 id=\\\"construction-marketing-challenges\\\">Construction marketing challenges\u003C/h3>\u003Cp>It is difficult for a new business to rise in the construction industry. It is especially hard for small construction companies. These businesses have to face competitive challenges from giants which are well established in the market and have strong marketing capability.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>This means that good marketing is crucial for small businesses in the construction industry. You're competing for customers with large corporations, and it can be hard to get their attention when your brand isn't very memorable or distinctive.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>That said, there are still great opportunities in this market because construction is a high-touch customer service business. Construction companies will spend weeks renovating a single house and then sell it to the customer. So they have lots more time than other types of companies to spend on things like customer service and building trust with customers.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Here are the top five challenges that construction companies face when it comes to their marketing:\u003C/p>\u003Col>\u003Cli>Marketing to real people who want to buy your products. That's not so hard. You can advertise on the web and in print media for free, but you have to make the ads relevant and compelling to actual customers.\u003C/li>\u003Cli>Selling more than one service. That's a chicken-and-egg problem: how do you get people to buy your services when they don't know they exist?\u003C/li>\u003Cli>Building a website that is easy to use and attractive to prospective customers. Designing is easy; actually building it isn't, especially if you have no website development experience.\u003C/li>\u003Cli>Getting your message across in an efficient way. You can hire a professional designer cheaply or do it yourself if you have enough skill with HTML, Photoshop, and other tools. But finding the right message can be more complicated than it seems, especially if you're starting from scratch with a brand new company.\u003C/li>\u003Cli>Making sure that your website shows up high on Google searches for related terms like \\\"construction services\\\" or \\\"construction company.\\\"\u003C/li>\u003C/ol>\u003Ch3 id=\\\"getting-construction-leads-as-a-small-business\\\">Getting construction leads as a small business\u003C/h3>\u003Cp>If you want to generate more leads for your construction business, you first need to understand your audience.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>For example, if you wanted to sell a small home renovation service, you'd first have to know who would be interested in buying it and where they will be located. Then after securing a few leads, you could ask them why they bought your service. Was it because they saw an ad? A postcard? A friend? This information can help you with future marketing efforts and increase referrals.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>However, as a construction company in a large area, you need to do more than just sell building materials or even finished homes. You need to create a relationship with the customer that lasts for years past the sale date so that when they are ready for another upgrade or addition (and this will happen eventually), they call your company first!\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Some questions to ask yourself are:\u003C/p>\u003Cul>\u003Cli>What’s hot right now in construction?\u003C/li>\u003Cli>What are people looking for when they look for a new home or building?\u003C/li>\u003Cli>What is the current style?\u003C/li>\u003Cli>How much are homes selling for right now?\u003C/li>\u003Cli>How much are shopping centers selling for?\u003C/li>\u003Cli>Are there any trends on either consumer or commercial construction?\u003C/li>\u003C/ul>\u003Cfigure class=\\\"kg-card kg-image-card\\\">\u003Cimg src=\\\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Ks_vV6B8ZcMNbRROuEGlmWSJmCkzftI6ZBQisSDjcF2-iGjQ9M8uoTm6GuQ9yzrrPGrjOLBKFnQXuhyFWGX4gvY20_m_WqK74nEMa_3imh6ihIMWYDpYia_L9S7IO80yNqQ1nYze\\\" class=\\\"kg-image\\\" alt=\\\"Construction project with three construction cranes\\\" loading=\\\"lazy\\\">\u003C/figure>\u003Cp>An easy thing to do is simply Google “hot construction trends.” You’ll get a sense of what people are looking for in their homes and what they’re willing to pay more for. If you take that information and use it in your marketing, you’ll start to attract more leads.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Another great way to keep up with trends is to look at photos of houses with exteriors that have been painted recently. Find colors that seem prevalent in your area, and then do some research to determine why homeowners choose those colors. Is there a new architectural trend that’s driving their decisions? If so, how can you make sure your materials reflect that trend?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>You can also keep up with what's new by following home design blogs for inspiration. Look for colors used together and find ways to incorporate them into your work. If a particular style is gaining popularity in another part of the country or world, consider adding it to your repertoire if it fits in with the neighborhood you’re working in.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Below, we explore some of the top marketing strategies for your construction company.\u003C/p>\u003Ch3 id=\\\"encourage-word-of-mouth\\\">Encourage word of mouth\u003C/h3>\u003Cp>One of the most efficient marketing strategies for local construction businesses is word of mouth.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>There are several ways that you can encourage word of mouth. The first is participating in meetups with your customers (if possible). For example, if you are a home builder, perhaps you can attend the neighborhood block party. If you are in commercial construction, maybe you can host a construction event for other companies with which you work.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>If this isn't possible for the type of business that you run, there are other ways that you can encourage word of mouth. You could consider joining BNI groups or participating in networking events. These are often filled with people who are looking for recommendations for great companies, and once they know about your company, they will undoubtedly spread the word!\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Another way to get more word-of-mouth referrals is to make it easier for your happy customers to refer you by providing them with pre-written testimonials and sample tweets they can use on social media.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>You can also offer discounts and rewards to people who refer your business. For example, you might promise a $50 gift card to anyone who refers a new customer who spends over $1,000 with you.\u003C/p>\u003Ch3 id=\\\"diversify-your-marketing-channels\\\">Diversify your marketing channels\u003C/h3>\u003Cfigure class=\\\"kg-card kg-image-card\\\">\u003Cimg src=\\\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/taCUbLtV41_tx8A1HORDJr5RmD-RClh0X22crycgiSKw8n8GDGZ7TbULLm6sEZhf3lkVmGgY7WT36DOvv-qs0WYAAAc9xWQmhRVHKsQXE-h2crBMLBomgEs3R0iwPXey6W2GHnNB\\\" class=\\\"kg-image\\\" alt=\\\"social media icons for construction companies\\\" loading=\\\"lazy\\\">\u003C/figure>\u003Cp>Research shows that consumers use at least ten different channels to find services. It's not enough for a construction business to rely on traditional marketing methods like print and TV ads or word of mouth to spread the word about its services. Instead, owners need to diversify their marketing channels to stay competitive in today's digital world.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>For example, if you only focus on SEO, you'll miss out on all the customers looking for your services on social media or through word of mouth.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>If you're just starting, it's important to choose marketing channels that are most likely to give you a return on investment (ROI). This will help you make sure that your business is sustainable and profitable.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>The best way to find out which channels work best for your business is by experimenting with different options and measuring the results.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>For example, if you run Facebook ads and get a lot of engagement from them, but no one hires you, Facebook isn't working for your business. You can try running ads on another platform instead or investing more money in SEO. You can also hire a marketing consultant who specializes in construction businesses to help guide your strategy to be more effective.\u003C/p>\u003Ch3 id=\\\"construction-business-ads\\\">Construction Business Ads\u003C/h3>\u003Cp>PPC marketing for construction companies can help small business owners find new leads while increasing conversion rates and sales.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Suppose you have a construction website with relevant content about remodeling projects or the services you offer. In that case, it could be displayed as an ad in front of the people searching for what you are offering in your area.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>For example, if someone searches for “remodel my kitchen” in Los Angeles, they will see your ad if they are located close enough to your company and you have bid on that specific keyword phrase with Google AdWords.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>The same principle applies to other forms of paid advertising like Facebook Ads or LinkedIn Ads, where you can target people based on their location, age, gender, and additional personal information they provide.\u003C/p>\u003Ch3 id=\\\"use-local-seo-to-your-advantage\\\">Use Local SEO to your advantage\u003C/h3>\u003Cfigure class=\\\"kg-card kg-image-card\\\">\u003Cimg src=\\\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/EYQTSv7a11lkauUOqtwj7vC8Kb9Hp3GCc9qtjP0JRLLVr3rD6HrX_wrVmkZSpsRNYMkgLzWPzwtXUM3cpN7zeTdofCdlhIVZ_KfgIYXPcY7N9Ryc75qglgt61n27yBilTgXqvKS9\\\" class=\\\"kg-image\\\" alt=\\\"Computer on desk with google search for SEO\\\" loading=\\\"lazy\\\">\u003C/figure>\u003Cp>A Google search for \\\"construction companies\\\" returns over 3 billion results.

You don't have to be an SEO expert; just paying attention to the basics can significantly improve your website's ranking.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Add yourself to local directories such as Google My Business or Yelp so that customers can find you easily when looking for builders in their local area. By adding your business to these directories, you can also provide information such as opening times, contact information, and directions to your offices which makes it easier for people to get in touch with you or visit you in person if they need help with their home renovation.\u003C/p>\u003Ch3 id=\\\"use-visual-content-on-social-media\\\">Use visual content on social media\u003C/h3>\u003Cp>Social media is an essential marketing tool for any business, big or small, and it’s no different for construction companies.

This can be anything from tips on hiring a contractor to new technology in the industry and what trends are happening over time in the market that your target customer is interested in.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>You can also send out monthly newsletters with links back to your website or blog.

While having the most popular SEO terms for industry-specific searches can be advantageous, it is essential that you also maximize your local SEO search results as well.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Why should you boost the local connection? According to\u003Ca href=\\\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/local-seo-stats\\\"> Hubspot\u003C/a>, nearly half of all internet searches are conducted by individuals seeking local information. What is more, more than 80% of those who search for local contact that business within 24 hours. This means that you have a wealth of local prospective clientele that are only a click away, so it is really important that you make sure that your SEO is capturing this potential neighborhood new business.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>In this article, I walk through the basics of local SEO and why it can be valuable. Then, I lay out some of the best ways to boost the local SEO for your online presence. These tips might not apply in all cases depending on the nature of your business, so you can pick and choose as desired. Perhaps a strong starting point for you is to review \u003Ca href=\\\"https://moz.com/local-search-ranking-factors\\\">Moz’s local search ranking factors\u003C/a> to see which might be most helpful. Implementing any of these strategies, however, is sure to bring you positive local SEO results.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>What is Local SEO?\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Local SEO works very much like organic SEO: it involves a carefully curated set of search terms that lead clientele to your site. Local SEO refers to search terms and keywords that help to connect your brand to any potential clients within your specific region or geographic area.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>As one example, let’s imagine a client  who has a celebratory event on the horizon and wants to order a custom cake. That client could search online for the best bakery, but he or she is most likely not interested in ordering a cake baked on the opposite side of the country. Rather, he or she is probably seeking a bakery nearby that can have a cake ready as early as tomorrow. This is where the local component comes into play: when this client searches for a “bakery near me” online, you can tailor \u003Cem>your\u003C/em> bakery’s local SEO such that your site pops up high in the list of returned options.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Why Should I Think Local?\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Such local connections can be an essential driver for the success and growth of your business. Building that local connection, though begins with local SEO. As mentioned earlier in the beginning of this article, a substantial percentage of online “shoppers” are doing so in search of local recommendations. Added to that fact is the significant number of individuals who use map listings, like those found in Google Maps, that are returned for searches to select a product or services. To rank in such maps, you need to make sure your local SEO is in force; without it, you won’t become the go-to business for that local client.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Why do people want these nearby listings? Most times it is thanks to a combination of efficiency and convenience. For some services, like A/C installation or electrical repair, clients will often need quick attention and immediate service that is only possible with a local provider. For other items, like furniture or car sales, consumers want to experience what they are buying before they invest, which again can only be accomplished in person. For still others, it is just a matter of time: they are searching, for example, for “plumber near me” because they want or need it at this very moment.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>How do I Implement Local SEO?\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\u003Cp>There are several really straightforward ways you can ensure your local SEO is superb. Let’s take a look at some of these now:\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Take a NAP\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\u003Cp>NAP (name, address, phone number) citations are a crucial way to connect your business to your local clientele. As reported in\u003Ca href=\\\"https://www.searchenginejournal.com/seo-101-local-seo-stats-need-consider-strategy/141086/\\\"> Search Engine Journal\u003C/a>, 50% of local internet queries are from people who are looking up a business address or phone number. With this in mind, if your site has out of date information or mismatched data across pages in relation to your basic NAP info, you run the risk of losing a lot of business. This is why it is best to review all aspects of your company’s online presence to ensure that your details are universally consistent.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Dive into Local Directories\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\u003Cp>In addition to checking your NAP citations across your web presence, you should similarly review how your business is reflected in local directories like\u003Ca href=\\\"https://www.yelp.com/\\\"> Yelp\u003C/a>,\u003Ca href=\\\"https://nextdoor.com/\\\"> NextDoor\u003C/a>, or\u003Ca href=\\\"https://www.yellowpages.com/\\\"> YellowPages\u003C/a>. While these might seem like secondary search sources, they are a massive source for information. Yelp alone has roughly 70 million unique users per month, with the vast majority of those users seeking ideas and recommendations for products and services within their local community. This means that, for some, these directory sites are the \u003Cem>only\u003C/em> place they visit, which means the information that appears there in relation to your brand thus need to be scrutinized with the same consistency as the contact information on your webpage. As part of this directory content clean up, you should also double-check to ensure that your listings are not duplicated.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>This can easily happen accidentally if you have multiple facets of your business or offer a new service – for example, if you own a sporting goods store but establish an equipment rental arm out of the same storefront. You might think that having multiple listings would be beneficial for your SEO results, however, the opposite is most often the case: the inconsistencies between these duplicate listings can cause your ranking in local search results to plummet. More generally, these double listings might confuse potential customers – one might ask: “if I visit this store, will I be able to shop for smaller sports items or can I only rent larger equipment?” – and might drive them away to your competition.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Google My Business and Google Maps\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Also important is optimizing your business profile on leading sites such as\u003Ca href=\\\"https://www.google.com/business/\\\"> Google My Business\u003C/a>. Not only is this site an important space for showcasing your brand, but it is also a means to link your business to \u003Ca href=\\\"https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/maps-platform/9-things-know-about-googles-maps-data-beyond-map\\\">Google Maps\u003C/a>, which boasts \u003Cem>more than one billion users\u003C/em> each month.  In short, refining your online presence within Google My Business is not just popular; it is critical for success. \u003Cbr>\u003C/p>\u003Cp>This enhanced profile begins by claiming your business on their platform, which only requires the click of a button but is a step overlooked by business owners at a surprising frequency. According to a 2016 study shared by the\u003Ca href=\\\"https://localmarketinginstitute.com/44-percent-have-google-my-business/\\\"> Local Marketing Institute\u003C/a>, more than half of local organizations had yet to claim their businesses. This percentage has assuredly dropped since then, but in case you are one of those few remaining stragglers now is the time to claim company, as it is an immediate way to boost your local reach.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>You’ll also want to make sure that you tailor your Google My Business listing to showcase the best that your company has to offer in accordance with Google’s\u003Ca href=\\\"https://support.google.com/business/answer/3038177#name\\\"> guidelines\u003C/a>. You can upload photos or add quick links to your phone number or website so that potential clients can access you with incredible speed. You can also access key analytics that reveal how your customers are interacting with your listing so that you can adjust accordingly.\u003Cbr>\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>More Mapping with Apple Maps and Bing Places\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Google My Business should be your first stop to streamlining your local SEO success, but you can go even further and seek similar results with \u003Ca href=\\\"https://www.apple.com/ios/maps/\\\">Apple Maps\u003C/a> and \u003Ca href=\\\"https://www.bingplaces.com/\\\">Bing Places\u003C/a>. \u003Cbr>\u003C/p>\u003Cp>With a more-than-30% market share in the United States alone, Apple Maps holds a notable chunk of market share and is still the default mapping feature for IPhone users. Bing Places trails with only a 7.8% market share, but nevertheless this is an adequately significant share of the market to take notice.  This means that, similar to Google My Business, you should take the same steps to claim your company and curate your content again in accordance with the \u003Ca href=\\\"https://bippermedia.com/apple-maps-local-seo-need-know/\\\">guidelines\u003C/a> of both platforms.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Rev Up your Reviews\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Reviews from local consumers are like gold and can go far in encouraging new customers to try out your products or services. According to\u003Ca href=\\\"https://www.99signals.com/local-seo-tools/\\\"> 99Signals\u003C/a>, 88% of consumers will rely upon the reviews they read online as much as they consider personal recommendations from friends or family. Moreover, more reviews can result in an improved local ranking on search returns. Given the value that these online reviews hold, try to identify ways to add to your review repertoire.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>You can extend the impact of your reviews by responding to each one. This is a must-do for reviews that are less-than-stellar, as it positions you as a professional who is open to critique and customer suggestions for improvement (it can also be a space to clarify reviews that might exaggerate or misinterpret exchanges). At the same time, showing your gratitude for positive reviews can make you an attractive option for those locals seeking an expert in your area. Moreover, your responses to past reviews might be just the encouragement needed for another client to review, and soon the reviews can snowball to your benefit.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Don’t Forget Facebook\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\u003Cp>When we think of social media like Facebook, we might not think of them as the go-to resource for local business searches. It might be surprising, but sites like Facebook are increasingly becoming sources for such information. They even have implemented a “Local” button, making it clear that finding local resources is a key driver for their users.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>With this in mind, it is important that you lavish the same attention to the details of your Facebook profile as you do your website. Make sure your page provides the most accurate and consistent contact details for your brand. At the same time, you should really emphasize local reviews and “check-ins” when applicable for your business. Similar to Google rankings, Facebook pays close attention check-ins as a signal of your business’s popularity, so asking your clients to check in can bring additional attention to your brand accordingly.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Insist on Instagram\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Instagram is also a fantastic means to build local connections, and it can also be a space to showcase the creativity of your approach or brand. Known for its seemingly endless stream of imagery, Instagram offers users a space to engage with one another that, as a local business owner, you can use to your advantage.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Post images, for instance, of your clients using your services or products and encourage them to comment (another means of reviewing your business that only takes seconds!). You can also repost content from other local businesses – maybe as a shout-out to your corner coffee shop or neighborhood auto shop – as a means of building your local community within the Instagram space.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Ramp Up Relevancy\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Another surefire way to build up your local SEO pull is to make sure your site is as customized for your local consumers as is possible. This can take the form of specific content on your website that links your services to your specific region. For example, if you have a physical storefront, you could include maps on your page that target your location. You can also specify a certain area you service and use keywords that target cities or neighborhoods. Need some help identifying those keywords? You can do some research within the helpful (paid) \u003Ca href=\\\"https://ahrefs.com/keywords-explorer\\\">Keyword Explorer\u003C/a>, or you can try other free tools.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>You can further amplify your local SEO connections by implementing schema. Schema are, in essence, tags of code that you add to your HTML fabric to strengthen your appeal on a search engine results page. Popular schema, like a star rating derived from your reviews or a publication date, can easily be added to your results list and can be a further draw for customers.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Seek Out Local SEO\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Regardless of your business, no matter your industry, when it comes to SEO it is always best to think local. Building the bridges to your local community can be a remarkably valuable stage in growing your reputation and your business. The only way to begin that growth, however, is to make sure that your local SEO is at the top of its game. Whether it is realigning your NAP citations or boosting your local connections on your website or social media accounts, taking these local SEO steps can put you steps ahead of your competition and can make you a local favorite.\u003C/p>\",\"comment_id\":\"60411e2537b9c22eb9a0a61d\",\"feature_image\":\"https://blog.weblime.com/content/images/2022/02/Local-SEO-must-haves.png\",\"featured\":false,\"visibility\":\"public\",\"email_recipient_filter\":\"none\",\"created_at\":\"2021-03-04T12:51:33.000-05:00\",\"updated_at\":\"2022-03-18T10:16:54.000-04:00\",\"published_at\":\"2021-03-04T13:13:16.000-05:00\",\"custom_excerpt\":\"SEO is without a doubt the name of the game when it comes to ranking high in search results.

Even the fanciest of websites won’t succeed if they are not performing at top rates. You can even take the exact same steps as your competition, but if you don’t watch your load times they will leave you in the dust in terms of Google rankings. In this article, I walk you through why these speeds should always stay on your radar. Then I break down some of the best steps you can take and tools you can use to improve your performance and hopefully boost your overall business.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>\u003Cstrong>Lost Seconds Mean Lost Business\u003C/strong>\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\u003Cp>The aesthetics of your website and your SEO optimization are both important, but all of that design work will be for nothing if your site visitors are forced to wait too long to enjoy it. It takes only a matter of seconds of load time to irritate visitors and lose traffic. Market research shows that even a \u003Cem>one-second \u003C/em>delay will result in:\u003C/p>\u003Cul>\u003Cli>Fewer page views\u003C/li>\u003Cli>Diminished client conversion rates\u003C/li>\u003Cli>Reduced customer satisfaction\u003C/li>\u003C/ul>\u003Cp>In addition to yielding such declines, increased load times can also increase your long loading times is your bounce rate. This, though, is not an increase you want to see. Bounce rate measures the number of single interactions (e.g., executing a transaction or submitting a form) a consumer has with a given site. While interactions might seem positive, a single-serving engagement is not desirable as the goal is to ensure ongoing business with that consumer. If your page takes more than 3 seconds to load, statistics show that your bounce rate can skyrocket to 90%.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>That means virtually no repeat business, which in turn means lost sales. What does this look like in real numbers? According to Amazon’s estimates, a one-second lag time in their page load could result in the \u003Ca href=\\\"https://www.fastcompany.com/1825005/how-one-second-could-cost-amazon-16-billion-sales\\\">loss of $1.6 billion in sales\u003C/a>in a given year. Another prime case is that of Walmart, who noted that an increase in load times on their ecommerce page resulted in a steep decline in client conversions. For every second they shaved off that load time, they witnessed a proportional \u003Ca href=\\\"https://medium.com/@vikigreen/impact-of-slow-page-load-time-on-website-performance-40d5c9ce568a\\\">2% conversion increase\u003C/a>.

Google, for example, has since 2017 operated on a mobile-first index, which ranks websites based on their appearance and functionality on mobile devices, not desktop or laptop computers. If your mobile site doesn’t have the stamina to load fast across internet-connected phones and tablets, your site’s ranking will only continue to plummet. This descent means lower visibility online and your ranking in returned search results will continue to fall lower.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>\u003Cstrong>Simple Steps to Superior Speed\u003C/strong>\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\u003Cp>If you weren’t convinced before, hopefully now you are on board with the fact that a faster site can bring only positives for your online presence.

Depending on what you’re building, you should adopt at least one of the many tools out there to help improve performance using sites like:\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>\u003Cstrong>Google Mobile-Friendly Test\u003C/strong>\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Straightforward and to-the-point, \u003Ca href=\\\"https://search.google.com/test/mobile-friendly\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">Google Mobile-Friendly Test\u003C/a> asks only one question: “Is your web page mobile-friendly”? It is a simple query that can mean the difference between the success and failure of your brand. Simply plug in your URL and you get immediate results.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>\u003Cstrong>GTMetrix\u003C/strong>\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\u003Cp>This \u003Ca href=\\\"https://gtmetrix.com/\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">site\u003C/a> is a veritable one-stop-shop for assessing the speed of your website. You can do a quick scan using their free features, or you can sign up for their professional accounts to gain access to features like essential toolkits, nonstop monitoring, and specialized reports tailored to your needs.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>\u003Cstrong>Pingdom\u003C/strong>\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\u003Cp>An industry leader in an already crowded field of website performance monitoring platforms, \u003Ca href=\\\"https://www.pingdom.com/website-monitoring/\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">Pingdom\u003C/a> is incredibly reliable in its around-the-clock observations on your site. As it tracks your website’s performance history and produces the data necessary to make essential decisions. Three different packages – Starter, Standard, and Advanced – allow you to select the features and reports that will best suit your specifications.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>\u003Cstrong>New Relic\u003C/strong>\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Setting itself apart from the competition with its level of professional insights, \u003Ca href=\\\"https://newrelic.com/\\\" rel=\\\"noreferrer noopener\\\">New Relic\u003C/a> is taking the website performance industry by storm. They offer an incredible level of data that is easy to understand so that you can make the changes your site needs to excel.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Once you’ve had the chance to analyze your site and you are sure that speed is a factor, it’s time to look at ways to limit that loading time for optimum website performance.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>\u003Cstrong>Limit the HTTPS Requests\u003C/strong>\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Think of your webpage and all of its components: images, scripts, and so on. Each of these elements makes use of an HTTPS request to load (remember that HTTPS format has replaced HTTP for major networks like Google) , so the more material you have the more requests will be made. These HTTPS requests can add up and begin to slow down your website’s loading time, but you can take steps to limit or minimize these requests relatively easily.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>One easy way you can assess how many HTTPS requests your page makes is to review the “Network” tab within Google Chrome’s Developer Tools dashboard. This tab reveals the load time for each component of your page and, at the very bottom of this list, relays the total number of requests made. In this space, you can reduce the total amount of requests by eliminating page components.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>\u003Cstrong>Consolidate and Compress Files\u003C/strong>\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Whatever you do, though, don’t start deleting all of your files! Many of those elements are crucial to your online presence, so before you bring down pages or eliminate important graphics, think instead about how you can save space by consolidating or compressing files. Files can be combined provided they work within the same platform (for example JavaScript).\u003C/p>\u003Cp>These files can also be compressed to remove redundant or peripheral whitespace and code segments or to simply cut down on the space they consume. To see what you might be able to compress on your page, you can always conduct a compression audit with a resource like \u003Ca href=\\\"http://www.gidnetwork.com/tools/gzip-test.php\\\">GIDNetwork\u003C/a>, which will tell you how large your page is without compression and where you might be able to cut back. If you already know that compression is in the cards, you enable compression on your files using applications like \u003Ca href=\\\"https://www.gnu.org/software/gzip/\\\">Gzip\u003C/a>, which will look for redundant components like those noted above and strip them away.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>\u003Cstrong>Cut Back on CSS and Javascript\u003C/strong>\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\u003Cp>If you cannot consolidate your CSS and Javascript files, then you might want to start here by eliminating them. These files can be important to your site, but the request to access them can only happen on an individual basis. This means some simply math: less CSS files = less load time.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>If you simply cannot part with these files, another potential work-around is to instruct them to load asynchronously. Traditionally, these files will load one at a time in synchronous fashion when called upon within a given page. With asynchronous loading, however, you can ask your files to load simultaneously and thereby help to cut down on your load time.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>\u003Cstrong>Call on Caching and Prefetching\u003C/strong>\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\u003Cp>In addition to implementing asynchronous loading to optimize speed, you can also take advantage of caching and prefetching. Both of these techniques fall under the category of “on-demand” loading, or lazy loading, and they are known as such because they can save a bit of your load time by either storing little bits of data or by loading only the components that a user will call upon.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>In the case of caching, parts of your page remain loaded on a computer’s hard drive so that, when you return to a site some components will already be loaded. In the case of prefetching, you predict where a visitor to your site will head next and preload that content so that, when they are ready to jump ahead their page is already being prepped. These tools are advanced, particularly that of prefetching as it requires a careful understanding of user behavior. If you really need your load times to drop, though, and you know your clients well, this can be a fantastic avenue to consider.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>\u003Cstrong>Consider a Content Delivery Network (CDN)\u003C/strong>\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\u003Cp>You know how irritating it is when you want to order your morning coffee but there is only one barista and a line of ten people in front of you? That backlog is, in essence, what happens when you host your website on one single server: all requests from your site are sent to the same location, bogging it down and potentially slowing your speeds.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>You can remedy this issue, though, by implementing a content delivery network (CDN), that spreads user requests across several sites around the globe. Users are directed to the site that is the geographically closest to them so that your content comes up quicker. Using a CDN can also help level out spikes in traffic so that your clients can use your site with ease. To be fair, CDNs can become pretty pricey, so they might not be an immediate choice; for those whose reach spans the globe, though, they are a strong feature to consider. There are also some fantastic free CDN options, like \u003Ca href=\\\"https://www.cloudflare.com/\\\">Cloudflare\u003C/a>, which can be an ideal starting point for those interested in experimenting with basic CDN features.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>\u003Cstrong>Hijack Your Host\u003C/strong>\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Given its prevalence in the marketplace, the odds are high that your site is up thanks to shared hosting, which means your site is on the same server as multiple sites. This is a popular option because it is often very affordable: for a few bucks a month, you can have your site up and running.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>If you have a speedy web host you might be fine, but when you begin to get more traffic to your site you will need to duel for space from the server  – CPU space, disk space, and so on – that you share with all the other clients. For example, let’s consider a retail website. According to \u003Ca href=\\\"https://www.machmetrics.com/speed-blog/average-page-load-times-websites-2018/\\\">MachMetrics\u003C/a>, in 2018 the average retail site required more than 120 resources to fully render its page. Now, imagine your retail website is hosted on a shared server with multiple retail sites requiring similar levels of resources, and you can see where the slow-up problem begins.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>One way to reduce this impact is to limit the number of sites on one server - for example, we only ever allow a maximum of 15 site installations on a single server so that heavy loads are prevented (and so that site security is maintained). You can also consider migrating your site to a virtual private server (VPS) or a dedicated server. VPSs, in essence, create a variation on the CDN; meanwhile, a dedicated server is just as it sounds: you have one server, just for you.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>\u003Cstrong>Create Your Best Website By Showcasing Speed\u003C/strong>\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Let’s face it: there is no space in our modern marketplace for a slowly loading website. The data tells us so, as does our own user experience. Think about the last time you visited a site and found yourself watching a scroll bar: it’s never positive. Multiply that by hundreds or thousands of customers, and it becomes clear very quickly that optimizing the speed of your site is key.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Don’t stop at SEO: surpass your competition by striving for the speediest site to meet client demands. The best part is that you can easily boost the speed of your site using these tips and resources. If you take the time to speed up your site today, you are setting yourself on course for a profitable tomorrow.\u003C/p>\",\"comment_id\":\"60411dd137b9c22eb9a0a616\",\"feature_image\":\"https://blog.weblime.com/content/images/2022/02/steps-for-a-speedy-website.png\",\"featured\":false,\"visibility\":\"public\",\"email_recipient_filter\":\"none\",\"created_at\":\"2021-03-04T12:50:09.000-05:00\",\"updated_at\":\"2022-02-26T16:49:48.000-05:00\",\"published_at\":\"2021-03-04T12:51:16.000-05:00\",\"custom_excerpt\":\"It takes just a few seconds of load time to irritate visitors and lose traffic.

But starting a home repair business is a great option for people who are just getting started because there is a relatively low start-up cost and you can do it as a one-person operation.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>A home improvement service doesn't require much in terms of equipment, so that's less of an upfront investment. You don't need new tools right away; instead, use whatever you already have around the house. As soon as you start making more money, though, consider investing in more high-quality tools and supplies.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>You can also do this as a side gig while you work another job. It isn't hard to schedule appointments around your full-time work schedule and this will give you some extra income on the side.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>The first step is to decide what kind of home improvement business you want to run. It could be general handyman repairs, like fixing leaky faucets or broken locks, or it could be something more specific, like installing solar panels or repairing drywall damage from water intrusion after a flood. Decide on the scope of work you want to do and make sure that it's something that you're going to enjoy doing over and over again.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>After choosing your service, you'll need to find customers. It's a good idea to target specific neighborhoods with high concentrations of homeowners and \u003Ca href=\\\"https://www.weblime.com/stories/how-to-promote-your-business-locally/\\\">promote your business locally\u003C/a>. You can also target owners of rental properties who need repairs done on their properties but don't have the time or expertise themselves to do them.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Once you've started working on your home improvement lead generation process, you'll need to let them know that your services are available. Do this by putting up flyers at nearby businesses, networking with other contractors in your area, and handing out flyers directly to homeowners or tenants in the neighborhood where you want to focus your efforts. \u003C/p>\u003Cp>Here are a few steps that will help you scale your home improvement marketing efforts.\u003C/p>\u003Ch3 id=\\\"capitalize-on-your-crm\\\">Capitalize on your CRM\u003C/h3>\u003Cp>Before starting any home improvement lead generation campaign, you need to choose a customer relations management (CRM) system.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>This is particularly important for those in the home improvement niche because the typical renovation or construction project involves multiple moving parts or phases.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>As a result, an effective CRM system can make the difference between keeping those projects on track to efficiently close the sales cycle versus letting crucial phases fall off the schedule and delay completion (or even lose clients).\u003C/p>\u003Cp>When we’ve worked with home improvement companies in the past we’ve found success with \u003Ca href=\\\"https://www.hubspot.com/crm\\\">HubSpot\u003C/a>, which offers a streamlined user interface and intuitive design that allows professionals to monitor every step in the sales pipeline.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Users can easily keep track of every phase, from initial consultation to final project invoicing, allowing home improvement professionals an ideal toolbox to build their client base.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>HubSpot is not alone in offering such a fantastic array of features; just make sure to do your research in advance so that you can be confident that you are making the most of your incoming leads.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>You should make sure that when choosing a CRM, you take these into consideration:\u003C/p>\u003Cp>1. A great CRM system that can handle all of the data you'll need to manage your team and your home improvement leads.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>2. The ability to scale as your company grows; you'll be able to easily add, change, or remove users from your CRM system as needed without having to worry about the potential for downtime when you do so.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>3. A user-friendly interface that allows for easy access and use for all people who have access to it -- no matter what their technical skill level is (nearly all CRM systems are web-based, which means that there's nothing for them to install; they just go online and begin using it).\u003C/p>\u003Cp>4. The ability to harness valuable data from every aspect of your business in order to make smarter, more informed decisions and enhance overall success.\u003C/p>\u003Ch3 id=\\\"maximize-marketing-outlets\\\">Maximize Marketing Outlets\u003C/h3>\u003Cp>Beyond a winning CRM system, you’ll also want to ensure that you pair it with a good marketing platform so that you can readily build and launch your home improvement marketing campaigns.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Feel free to pull out all the stops here and take advantage of the incredible variety of online marketing options available today. Some of the most popular for those within the home improvement industry include:\u003C/p>\u003Cul>\u003Cli>Google, which was responsible for 94% of total online organic traffic in 2019;*\u003C/li>\u003Cli>Facebook, which statistically draws in users for one out of every six minutes they are online*;\u003C/li>\u003Cli>Yelp, which has boasted more than 170 million unique visitors each month**; and\u003C/li>\u003Cli>Home improvement marketplaces (e.g., Houzz, Angie’s List, Home Advisor, Thumbtack), which can give your home improvement company an enhanced position for lead generation in the online market if you select the structure and components of your marketing campaigns correctly.\u003C/li>\u003C/ul>\u003Cp>In a perfect world, we would all have the funds to pursue all of these options; if the budget is tight, though, you should choose only one or two platforms that you are comfortable with and that you can commit to master. You can then use these initial platforms as a springboard in the future as you gain traction and can eventually scale to other platforms.\u003C/p>\u003Ch3 id=\\\"assessing-and-syncing-advertising-structure\\\">Assessing and Syncing Advertising Structure\u003C/h3>\u003Cp>Also important is to assess what engaging with these various platforms will actually provide for you and then have them in sync so that you are effectively targeting the same audience.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Some of these platforms, for instance, Angie’s List, Houzz, and Home Advisor will devour the cash you dish out to get you a bundle of (sometimes questionable) home improvement leads in return. In other words, while you can get leads for a simple cost variable, you’re not guaranteed a sale. That’s where you’ll need to find ways to encourage the progression/conversion of each home improvement lead documented in your CRM system such that each will hopefully culminate in a sale (or, a thorough understanding that a lead is a dud after having done everything to try and convert the lead to a home improvement project).\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Others, though, such as Facebook or Google, require you to conceptualize, build, and track your ad and its performance over time. This path is time-consuming and will require the sometimes tedious task of A/B testing as well as a substantial financial investment. What it also means, though, is that you can really flex your creativity. If you have the endurance to survive this marketing marathon, the reward at the end is that you typically have an exceptional ad that is well-tailored to your optimum new clients.\u003C/p>\u003Ch3 id=\\\"facebook-home-improvement-ad-example\\\">Facebook Home Improvement Ad Example\u003C/h3>\u003Cp>Let’s look briefly at some of the Facebook ads we’ve run for our home improvement company clients in recent years:\u003C/p>\u003Cfigure class=\\\"kg-card kg-image-card\\\">\u003Cimg src=\\\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/rsu6R0x2MICtGE6XR363JinRXMm63rTksJAAueuTaHIqwfxHMY0hVn4kFTsWn3BlfyIgOX8UB-imfYOmxDufKRKrKwn-v558itp11CIfmQNqB3FWiDldHS32Qb6D4zHTjYLVwQQM\\\" class=\\\"kg-image\\\" alt=\\\"Facebook Home Improvement Ad\\\" loading=\\\"lazy\\\">\u003C/figure>\u003Cfigure class=\\\"kg-card kg-image-card\\\">\u003Cimg src=\\\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/o5dz0KNsQdNeoVhep-f4bqp3nB2AXaNX77WXJkPhz6eIdztl3cwm7h2Sn0SllCoQqOOB922KuxLmqY6sUG4zTHrnZjFYevBAQrW-D8NqbhLVK9kOnb9iUCygVpA66CC4bA14hpf9\\\" class=\\\"kg-image\\\" alt=\\\"Facebook Home Improvement Marketing Ad\\\" loading=\\\"lazy\\\">\u003C/figure>\u003Cp>The ads had several campaign initiatives. The first was to generate traffic to the website while also getting exposure for the page. Another ad campaign focused on pushing a video that we’d eventually retarget (the viewers that watched more than 15 seconds of the video) in another campaign. We were able to sync these campaigns by taking advantage of the fact that Facebook allows you to build audiences and work with lists.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>In our recent work with home improvement companies, we focused on a specific list that was comprised of a certain age group in a defined demographic, which allowed our exposure to remain consistent and focused. We essentially kept chasing the same live batch of 300k users. The fact that this list was live and kicking was essential and really made it a “golden goose,” because it meant that the list was slowly turning over to be consistently filled with viable, potential clientele conversions.  While one person might age out of our criteria range or move out of our demographic region, another one filters in to take that vacated place. This can mean a dramatic surge in lead generation for your home improvement company, and it is a tactic that can keep your \u003Ca href=\\\"https://www.weblime.com/stories/how-to-market-a-home-renovation-business/\\\">marketing strategy\u003C/a> breathing on the Facebook end.\u003C/p>\u003Ch3 id=\\\"google-home-improvement-ad-example\\\">Google Home Improvement Ad Example\u003C/h3>\u003Cp>With Google, you can achieve similar results.

Since I plan to publish a year in review every year, this first one is an attempt to lay the groundwork for WebLime’s inception and share some of the background story of how everything began.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>CHANGE IS INEVITABLE\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\u003Cp>At the end of March 2020, I woke up to a surprising yet somewhat anticipated meeting invite from the president of the company I previously worked for. With Covid-19 quickly bringing the world to its knees, and the fact that I didn’t report directly to the president, the meeting invite didn’t leave me muddled. After all, we were providing a service to help companies cultivate the culture within their office. The lockdowns that started in California, spread to other states and left offices empty within a matter of weeks.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Though the departure from my previous employer wasn’t much of a surprise, as with every hard turn in life, it sent me on a mental rollercoaster. Furloughed and on lockdown, with my spouse, our little one and the dog, I was forced to do some extensive thinking.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>It's well known that humans don't like change. And in most cases, we’ll do our best to avoid it at all costs. But this was different. This was mother natures’ crazy way of forcing millions of people into the uncomfortable territory of change—whether they accepted it or not. Change was on the horizon for millions of people around the globe. And I was one of those millions facing the dreadful yet much anticipated furloughed status.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>I wanted to take my time with this decision. It’s almost as if the constant and ever growing death toll from the pandemic, was to act as a reminder of the importance to this decision. Life is short. Death is inevitable. If there was ever a reminder of life being short, this was it. Knocking at all of our doors - every single day. To dive headfirst into a job hunt seemed typical; the natural approach to life. But is that what would make me happy?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>REACH FOR THE SKY\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\u003Cp>I quickly came to realize that I’d like to embark on an entrepreneurial journey - again. And although past experiences have left both my spouse and I scarred, her endorsement was granted. And that was the first and hardest hurdle to overcome.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>The rules this time would be different. I’d play it safer this time. No startup bullshit. No recruiting of investors or external funding of any kind. I wanted to build a company that outlasts the capitalistic drench the demand for the dollar can instill.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>The only way I thought of doing this was to adopt the Tesla approach. For those unfamiliar, Musk’s approach to electrifying the automobile industry was to start with developing the more expensive cars and slowly gain the means and experience to build for the mass. In my case, the end goal is to build projects for the mass. And to achieve that goal, I intended to start building products and solutions for clients. As we develop traction and momentum, we’d hopefully gain enough experience and the means to release our own products and services to the world. In fact, some of our very own ideas could arise from supporting our clients’ businesses.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>I somewhat knew how I wanted this company to operate. As mentioned, office culture was at the heart of my previous job. The commute to work for me - give or take - was an hour long both ways. On my luckier days, when everything went spanky smooth with the trains, I’d get home in time to say goodnight to my little one.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Disconnected from the world and underground for most of my commute, I picked up a habit of listening to podcasts and reading. And sure enough, I wound up indulging in the concept of remote work. It occurred to me that, if ever possible, a simple reduction of my commute would free up another 2 hours of my day. Every day! Can you imagine? An extra 10 hours per week. Needless to say, my commute became obsessive study time around the concept of remote work and what my future company could possibly look like. This of course led to an array of findings around the topic.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Zapier’s co-founder and CEO Wade Foster said it best when it comes to remote work: “I jump right into work when I’m ready. And leave when I’m done. There’s zero friction between working and not.”\u003C/p>\u003Cp>If you’re interested in learning more about this topic, Zappier’s \u003Ca href=\\\"https://zapier.com/learn/remote-work/\\\">Ultimate guide to remote work\u003C/a> is a good place to start.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>And with my partner’s blessings, two things were clear to me: I’m going to start a digital agency, and it’s going to be fully remote.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>GETTING MY FEET WET\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\u003Cp>I knew that I had a ton of technological experience. And I wanted to offer solutions that were an all-in-one. No upselling techniques. You pay and you get a worry-free experience. If clients bought our hosting plan or any type of development project, I didn’t want them bothered with all the noise that may backlash (i.e security, backups). Half the folks being upsold from the big hosting firms have no idea what they’re paying for, and can hardly say no to the flashy discount offers being presented. Okay, I’m not sure if that last stat really is 50% but it’s up there. And folks are reluctant to say no to a security upsell that claims it will keep them safe from millions of hackers out there.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Gaining initial momentum was tough. Deciding how everything will operate logistically was a long journey. You try to make the best decisions and hope that you're calling the right shots. From billing and invoicing to onboarding new clients, you wear plenty of hats; and at times, could feel a bit all over the place and lost.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>My younger sister, Coral, is obsessed with dogs. A lot of her free time as a child was devoted to volunteer work and extensive animal care, with a heart for pitbulls. When considering my immediate circle, I felt this could be a great start. Perhaps, one of the many non-profits she’d worked for, would need a website, or even help with something technological that was above their means. And with that idea we ran full speed ahead.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>We quickly learned that most non-profits operate on a nearly zero cash flow basis. And at first glance, this didn’t seem to be an issue. After all, I was looking to network and grow while supporting a great cause. But, this tough reality meant that unless operated extremely well, many nonprofits struggle to focus on their mission and wind up fighting just to stay afloat, especially this year.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>We learned that we needed to find and target more stable organizations. The catch was that in most cases if they were stable, their online presence was already squared away. But we kept at it. With a firm belief in a reciprocity relationship, we carried on to the many social and networking groups that Coral was connected to. I was keen on partnering with a well-organized non-profit that somehow neglected their online presence.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>After sorting through endless messages, and having to repeatedly explain why our intentions were sincere, we finally found an interesting opportunity, our first potential prospect, Paws Between Homes. A non-profit that just got their tax ID and is run by a special someone named Cole. Katie, who helped Cole get Paws Between Homes going, saw one of Coral’s messages and reached out asking for help. The introduction to Cole was made and after sharing a bit of his legal background, he explained that Atlanta has one of the highest eviction rates in the United States and that it’s affecting dogs and not just their humans. Evictions led to the surrender of hundreds of family pets to area animal shelters each year. And while PBH can’t entirely stop this phenomenon, they passionately believed that if people got back on their feet in a new home, they should be able to do so as a complete family with no members left behind.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>I promised Cole that for as long as I could, PBH wouldn’t need to worry about anything related to tech nor the cost of it. We quickly agreed on the basics and I went to work on a simple site for PBH that would act as a starting point for their launch.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>You can check out their website \u003Ca href=\\\"https://pawsbetweenhomes.org/\\\">here\u003C/a>.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>RINSE &amp; REPEAT\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Paws Between Homes was a first of many attempts to build momentum. And it solidified and gave assurance that I was onto something.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>My next move was to tap into my mom’s network. She’d been networking for \u003Ca href=\\\"https://ericbhomeimprovement.com/\\\">Eric B Home Improvement\u003C/a> for over a decade and has formed ever-lasting relationships. If there was a network to try and tap into - it was hers. After getting a few non profits under my belt for free, it’s fair to say that I was ready for the real deal. I gave Eric B a quick online face lift, structured a lead capturing system (CRM) for their business, launched marketing campaigns for them, and gave my mom plenty to boast about. Within a matter of months, Eric B was an entirely new business. Until this very day, leads are generated in a very efficient and systematic approach. My parents’ home improvement business improved drastically. All while enduring plenty of cancellations, derived from uncertainty the pandemic brought about.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>At this point, I didn’t even need to explain to my mom what I was offering. She proudly started telling business partners what was happening with her business. The leads came in hot and were more relevant than ever before. She couldn’t stop talking about what was happening. As I learned while working for Apple, passion is contiguous. And when it’s authentic, it’s nearly impossible for it to not rub on to you.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>At one point, I decided to network with various local groups. This meant constant Zoom calls with folks I’d never met. Of course, all with a mutual interest in referrals and business layups. It’s an interesting way to build yourself a group of allies. And while that may work for many, and certainly did wonders for my mom - for me it wasn’t as appealing. Something about showing up to a networking group and claiming my strengths are web development and digital marketing felt contradictory. I forced myself to carry on with this approach for a few months but came to the realization that it just wasn’t for me. And I’m content with that.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>OUR FIRST PRODUCT\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\u003Cp>During WebLime’s first year we began to feel growing pain. The process for handling the first few websites wasn’t going to work for more than 10 websites. Managing the server side became hefty. I realized that in our own small bubble we were quickly facing scaling issues. My dear friend and tech mentor Roee, taught me some of the best methods to running a server. And for a while everything seemed great. It wasn’t until a client all of a sudden skipped a payment, or various other issues that surfaced, that I had to stop everything I was doing to manually update the server. The process wasn’t as cohesive and automated as it should be; and it certainly wasn’t feasible if we wanted to scale to 100 projects or more.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>From the technical constraints to how payments should properly integrate with the operation, WebLime needed to provide a robust, scalable solution. Something that would allow me to focus on the business’ growth and not be occupied with previous deals we had. Years ago, I researched the possible solutions. Envisioning a world where I’d one day own an agency and want to achieve a similar outcome. And here I was, facing this very issue head on, in real life.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>It took a few months of great talent, collaborative efforts and intense development for me to finally launch \u003Ca href=\\\"https://digitalatar.com/\\\">DigitalAtar\u003C/a>. A platform that would not only allow WebLime to scale with more than 5 to 10 clients but provide them a rich offering of services.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Here’s a snippet of some advantages to the launch of DigitalAtar:\u003C/p>\u003Cul>\u003Cli>Scale thousands of websites\u003C/li>\u003Cli>Auto suspend clients that don’t make payments\u003C/li>\u003Cli>Provide clients with business email solutions\u003C/li>\u003Cli>Provide clients with domains\u003C/li>\u003Cli>Provide clients a GUI to login/logout and handle their payments in one place\u003C/li>\u003Cli>Allow clients to manage their server environment via Cpanel\u003C/li>\u003C/ul>\u003Cp>With DigitalAtar in place, WebLime can finally return to provide development solutions. Our approach to being bootstrapped and slowly launching our own products worked faster than I could ever anticipate.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>2021 AND BEYOND\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\u003Cp>2020 had a significant impact on the world; saying goodbye to this historical year is symbolic and a privilege. From my career challenges, to my family’s sacrifice through these hard times, this insanely twisted year is coming to an end!\u003C/p>\u003Cp>I’m looking at 2021 with a lot of desire and optimism.

Research around team tactics and individual player’s traits are intensively analyzed. The research is crucial so that teams arrive in their best form, and are aware of their opponent’s every move. Of course, all resulting in a much-anticipated showdown.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Similarly, as a business owner, you can learn a lot from studying your competition. Whether you’re working on a new business or improving your business, there’s plenty to learn from companies in your niche. In the business world, it may not win you a particular game but will certainly position you to capitalize on resources and have a serious advantage in your vertical.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>At WebLime, when we decide to take on a new client, the very first task we tackle is research. Heavy research. The journey starts with a simple Google search and leads on to an exciting adventure of new findings and knowledge. We learn about both the competitor landscape as well as our new client’s niche. In this article, we’ll walk you through an example of our research process, and share tips and resources to help you conduct similar research and gain valuable insight from competitors.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>For the purpose of this scenario, we’ll assume we have a new client in the insurance industry. We’ll call this client Erie Insurance. Let’s see what we can gather about this new client!\u003C/p>\u003Cp>First thing first, let's run a few Google searches.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>The first search will be simply to Google “Erie Insurance”. Here’s what that looks like:\u003C/p>\u003Cfigure class=\\\"kg-card kg-image-card\\\">\u003Cimg src=\\\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/urb27XhebvUtJEwyiKNmcTbnJrMZnPprEztUM22QSTg1nzzWrAqIDSymt8QKVXaC0tOPg6b9ixe5vQRLVpKrKp-OW2n-7Q3y9Q5Sd68SyoMf1bO41nrFzLZ9sKvadDlps736yiMu\\\" class=\\\"kg-image\\\" alt=\\\"How to Learn From Your Competition Google Search\\\" loading=\\\"lazy\\\">\u003C/figure>\u003Cp>At first glance, it appears we’re in a competitive landscape. Without using additional tools we can already tell that Google has over 33 million results for our query. The organic side, the main section a user typically glances at initially, is bombarded with Google Ads. Something else that catches the eye right away, is the lack of social profiles in the business listing (on the right). For such a competitive landscape, to only have Twitter and Linkedin as your way of reaching clients is selling yourself short. The actual organic results are the ones below the ads on the left. That section looks like this:\u003C/p>\u003Cfigure class=\\\"kg-card kg-image-card\\\">\u003Cimg src=\\\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/NM3REnQrq1RYwhueYvkCZPpCO-vki6wcTPcaxLAUNR8xt5RbY0GpBJhVXEefCATo3dx_4V7UPjzRLtuAYeF8RgsLh4BAbV9_IMBovQ3P9xDL-QXtncqtqrq-01vXlCWAvmHzCx53\\\" class=\\\"kg-image\\\" alt=\\\"How to Learn From Your Competition Google Results\\\" loading=\\\"lazy\\\">\u003C/figure>\u003Cp>As for the organic results, it appears half of the results on the first page are neither owned nor controlled by Erie Insurance. Let’s dive deeper to develop a better understanding.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>The next step is to start learning about the overall landscape. Essentially, we start to look at what Erie is doing and what their competitors are doing. Here’s where we begin to build on the sports analogy and improve our study case.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Finding competitors can come from both asking your client, and you guessed it, asking Google. Your client will share some of their struggles as to who they lose business to the most. Google will give you even more insight into that thought process. In fact, they sometimes will provide you with more than what the client is aware of.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>My favorite search for this approach is to simply start typing into Google the company name and adding “vs”. Stop right after. Don’t actually finish the search. Let Google recommend what it thinks we're looking for. Typically, this will lead you to some comparisons and searches that, in this particular case, millions of people are searching. In essence, we’re utilizing Google’s machine learning to our advantage.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Lets see what this would look like according to Dr. Google:\u003C/p>\u003Cfigure class=\\\"kg-card kg-image-card\\\">\u003Cimg src=\\\"https://res-1.cloudinary.com/hsmap5mlr/image/upload/q_auto/v1/ghost-blog-images/learn-from-your-competition.png\\\" class=\\\"kg-image\\\" alt=\\\"Google search to learn from your competition\\\" loading=\\\"lazy\\\" width=\\\"702\\\" height=\\\"530\\\">\u003C/figure>\u003Cp>Viola! From such a simple Google search, we now have a general idea of competitors in our niche. At this point, we don’t know who’s more relevant than not but we can start to compile a list for insight. This will give us the foundation to be productive both with our work and insight to share with our client.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>The next step is to dive into a few of the recommendations. We want to understand who’s more relevant to what we’re working on. For this example, we’ll assume that Google hit the nail on the head. And with that understanding, we’ll stick with the top four recommendations: Geico, State Farm, USAA, Allstate.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Note: we highly recommend to review every result and not assume anything! :)\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Now, let’s see what our first step would look like for the competitors we found:\u003C/p>\u003Cfigure class=\\\"kg-card kg-image-card\\\">\u003Cimg src=\\\"https://res-3.cloudinary.com/hsmap5mlr/image/upload/q_auto/v1/ghost-blog-images/learn-from-competition-company-searches.png\\\" class=\\\"kg-image\\\" alt=\\\"Google My Business company profile\\\" loading=\\\"lazy\\\" width=\\\"708\\\" height=\\\"1232\\\">\u003C/figure>\u003Cp>To make our life easier, let’s compare one of the competitors to our client, side by side:\u003C/p>\u003Cfigure class=\\\"kg-card kg-image-card\\\">\u003Cimg src=\\\"https://res-1.cloudinary.com/hsmap5mlr/image/upload/q_auto/v1/ghost-blog-images/competition-company-comparison.png\\\" class=\\\"kg-image\\\" alt=\\\"Google My Business company profile\\\" loading=\\\"lazy\\\" width=\\\"710\\\" height=\\\"1252\\\">\u003C/figure>\u003Cp>\u003Cbr>As previously mentioned, the first thing that strikes negatively for Erie is the social profiles. Either they don’t exist, or Google doesn’t recognize them; either way this isn’t good. And regardless of the social profiles existing or not, there’s work to do to fix the issue. Something else that surfaces is the Sales Service number. One assumption could be that many clients are dropped right there, with the phone number being so much more accessible for Geico than Erie. Without diving too deep into this, it’s clear Geico has set the groundwork for a prospect to convert.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Another step to take when trying to learn from your competition is dissecting the actual online presence and not just what Google shows us. That can be diving into websites, social profiles, or even external tools that can give us more insight into the situation at hand.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Some questions to keep in mind:\u003C/p>\u003Cul>\u003Cli>What do they do that we don’t and vice versa?\u003C/li>\u003Cli>How’s the UI/UX?\u003C/li>\u003Cli>How good is their website?\u003C/li>\u003Cli>How good are their social profiles?\u003C/li>\u003Cli>What tech stack are they using?

One of my personal favorites is SimilarWeb. Taken directly from their website, here’s the basic description of what their platform is all about:\u003C/p>\u003Cp>We empower you with the insights you need to win your market.

From a quick SimilarWeb query, we can gain additional insight into our competitors and niche research.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Here’s a few snapshots of the query for Geico themselves:\u003C/p>\u003Cfigure class=\\\"kg-card kg-image-card\\\">\u003Cimg src=\\\"https://res-3.cloudinary.com/hsmap5mlr/image/upload/q_auto/v1/ghost-blog-images/Company-online-Traffic-Overview.png\\\" class=\\\"kg-image\\\" alt=\\\"SimilarWeb company online profile overview\\\" loading=\\\"lazy\\\" width=\\\"1600\\\" height=\\\"1042\\\">\u003C/figure>\u003Cfigure class=\\\"kg-card kg-image-card\\\">\u003Cimg src=\\\"https://res-4.cloudinary.com/hsmap5mlr/image/upload/q_auto/v1/ghost-blog-images/Company-Traffic-Sources-overview.png\\\" class=\\\"kg-image\\\" alt=\\\"SimilarWeb company traffic sources\\\" loading=\\\"lazy\\\" width=\\\"1600\\\" height=\\\"483\\\">\u003C/figure>\u003Cfigure class=\\\"kg-card kg-image-card\\\">\u003Cimg src=\\\"https://res-1.cloudinary.com/hsmap5mlr/image/upload/q_auto/v1/ghost-blog-images/company-traffic-Social-Breakdown.png\\\" class=\\\"kg-image\\\" alt=\\\"SimilarWeb company traffic social channels\\\" loading=\\\"lazy\\\" width=\\\"1600\\\" height=\\\"852\\\">\u003C/figure>\u003Cp>A lot more is available on their site; To not overwhelm this post, I’ll display just a few of the metrics available.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>So, what can we learn from this?\u003C/p>\u003Cp>For one, with only 1.44% of their traffic coming from social platforms, it’s fair to assume their success is with Google Search. 56% of Geico’s visitors are direct traffic, typing in “Geico”, or Geico.com. The other visitors may be searching more generic terms such as “car insurance”. So if the client’s marketing budget is limited, this might be an enormous point to dissect further with the client. You want to focus on where your potential customers already are—in this case they’re in the Google search results.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>If you do want to include a bit of social activity as well, it’s clear that Facebook and Youtube would be your main winners. From the 1.44% of overall traffic, 72% comes from Facebook and 20% comes from YouTube. Of course, more should be looked into to make these decisions and these quick assumptions we make are to help spark thoughts and directions in your research.\u003C/p>\u003Cfigure class=\\\"kg-card kg-image-card\\\">\u003Cimg src=\\\"https://res-5.cloudinary.com/hsmap5mlr/image/upload/q_auto/v1/ghost-blog-images/online-traffic-Audience-Interest.png\\\" class=\\\"kg-image\\\" alt=\\\"Company traffic audience overview\\\" loading=\\\"lazy\\\" width=\\\"1600\\\" height=\\\"1165\\\">\u003C/figure>\u003Cp>Another useful finding that stands out is the Audience Interests. Having this to start off with is immensful. There are cases where building a marketing funnel can get tricky. Similarweb’s tool is essentially providing us a very robust foundation to begin our deeper understanding of what the potential customers are interested in, what the competitors are doing, and in some cases what they’re not doing.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>The icing on the cake?\u003C/p>\u003Cfigure class=\\\"kg-card kg-image-card\\\">\u003Cimg src=\\\"https://res-1.cloudinary.com/hsmap5mlr/image/upload/q_auto/v1/ghost-blog-images/Company-Competitors-overivew.png\\\" class=\\\"kg-image\\\" alt=\\\"Competitors and similar sites to learn from\\\" loading=\\\"lazy\\\" width=\\\"1600\\\" height=\\\"907\\\">\u003C/figure>\u003Cp>The competitors &amp; Similar sites section! Without doing any prior research, this alone is giving us an incredible list to consider when working in this niche. Without lifting a finger, we have a list of 10 competitors that are in our prospect’s landscape.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>We can easily browse through these sites and take note of what they’re doing well, and what might be missing. Is the website easy to navigate? Are the calls to action compelling? What type of content are they using? (blog posts, how-to guides, videos, etc.)\u003C/p>\u003Cp>To carry on with our research, let’s take one more step. Something I like to look at is how active the competitor really is. What are they advertising on social pages? In the SimilarWeb check, we learned Geico was not too crazy about social platforms but they were relatively active in a select few. Let’s take a look at what seemed to be their top choice for social activity: Facebook.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>In recent privacy chaos that Facebook experienced, one of the outcomes they had to adopt was to provide Business Page transparency. Hence, Facebook allows you to view every single Ad that’s run across their network - and that’s gigantic for so many reasons. You can easily understand what one’s target is, what their message is, and most importantly what is working best. To view all of this check out the \u003Ca href=\\\"https://www.facebook.com/ads/library/?active_status=all&amp;ad_type=political_and_issue_ads&amp;country=US\\\">Facebook Ad Library\u003C/a>.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Utilizing the search bar, you can pull up any business page you want to explore. In our case, we’ll stick with Geico.\u003C/p>\u003Cfigure class=\\\"kg-card kg-image-card\\\">\u003Cimg src=\\\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/e7Jg93rnajOrFNwKJH-ZfsfTuWM2HeRilEz7ZTPU4bUNBo2dZ1cMrMGVZcdo2NVcXyIN8mYmdo60KkXxEDpDSpcXRDIrA1rST6UFVmeAMEWfto4zdqEZ4d-akQHFdSrxAdBUJqZ3\\\" class=\\\"kg-image\\\" alt=\\\"How to Learn From Your Competition Facebook Search Ad\\\" loading=\\\"lazy\\\">\u003C/figure>\u003Cp>Like magic, you can view everything their marketing team has put together and where they’re pushing it most.\u003C/p>\u003Cfigure class=\\\"kg-card kg-image-card\\\">\u003Cimg src=\\\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/S5CNbfYtQt3TMDboKVc1V-0K3d-hCs7pi2t8WNkwY1_mSqj-QIddfFd0mVtXC-tVEr3BPmqTmYH5RkbL1JVfi3T2NO4AzdVLuGz89ERvFK_Tn-V909gODYwiYBFEHJmI1BMzBt8c\\\" class=\\\"kg-image\\\" alt=\\\"How to Learn From Your Competition Facebook Ads Library Results\\\" loading=\\\"lazy\\\">\u003C/figure>\u003Cp>For example, in these boxes we can learn that Geico is actually active not just on Facebook, but also Instagram. Scrolling further down reveals some messages are geared only to Facebook while others are sent to both. This can reveal tremendous insight. Typically, a lot of work and thought goes into these ads. From research to whom to guide the message to, to our compeittor’s design and content departments all coming together to put these ads to work. At the time of this writing, Geico is running over a staggering 300 unique ads!\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Chances are that you don’t have an ad budget anywhere close to Geico. But you can gain valuable insight by looking at their ads.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Of course, this example shows our client at hand - or their competitor Geico. In a similar approach to our competitor research, pulling up some competitors in Facebook's Ad Library can’t hurt. The methodology to gather insights on a prospect and their competitors should remain dynamic. You don’t want to use only one tool and miss what else is out there. And at the same time, it’s important to remain focused. So while I stick to a somewhat known methodology, it’s important to allow yourself some freedom during your research.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>The most important element to research is to have a structure. There’s no secret recipe or a set blueprint, but rather a combination of tactics and tools to adopt and utilize. While in our case Geico had over 300 ads on Facebook, another niche or competitor may have led us to a completely different outcome; and therefore a completely different journey and set of tools.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>The purpose of this writing is to show how much insight can be garnered on a particular prospect and their competitors - without paying a single penny. Researching your competitors isn’t a substitute for spending time and investing in a marketing plan. And it won’t 10x your business overnight. However, understanding your competition and learning what works and doesn’t work will save you time and effort.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>As we’ve shown, there are plenty of free and paid tools to form your unique approach to all of this. But oftentimes a lot of what you’d like to know is out for grabs, you just need to learn how to find it and apply it.\u003C/p>\",\"comment_id\":\"603fe90537b9c22eb9a0a5f8\",\"feature_image\":null,\"featured\":false,\"visibility\":\"public\",\"email_recipient_filter\":\"none\",\"created_at\":\"2021-03-03T14:52:37.000-05:00\",\"updated_at\":\"2022-02-07T10:30:41.000-05:00\",\"published_at\":\"2021-03-03T14:53:20.000-05:00\",\"custom_excerpt\":\"One of the best ways to improve your online presence is to learn from your competition.

Whether that was a good or bad experience for you, it proved that work can be done and money can be made from anywhere. All you need is a computer and WiFi connection.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Even before 2020, online businesses were popular around the world. For many people, it sounds like a dream job. You can work from your computer, tablet, or phone and have access to customers anywhere in the world. An online business requires fewer physical resources, and your shop can be open 24/7.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>The ease of setting up an online business can cause entrepreneurs to start a new venture without putting much thought into it. That’s likely one of the reasons why 90% of online businesses fail within their first 120 days.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>In this post, we’ll give you three practical tips to start your own online business and hopefully (we can’t guarantee it) find success.\u003C/p>\u003Ch2 id=\\\"start-with-a-plan\\\">Start with a plan\u003C/h2>\u003Cp>Many brick and mortar businesses require a significant starting budget and a much greater commitment than an online business. Traditional shops that have a physical location require a detailed business plan.\u003Cbr>\u003C/p>\u003Cp>You can start an online business or open up a new online shop in just a few minutes. But, just because you can doesn’t mean you should!\u003C/p>\u003Cp>It’s important to recognize that an online business is still a business: Online businesses offer many advantages, such as keeping startup costs low, but they still require significant planning, skill acquisition, hard work, and maintenance. If you ignore the planning stages, it’s unlikely to stand any chance of succeeding.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>There are quite a few things that will require your planning. Understand that your goal shouldn’t be to launch your new business as soon as humanly possible. Instead, give yourself a few weeks to develop a business plan. Not only will your plan increase the chances of success, but you will also find out if your new idea is something you’re passionate about and something worth pursuing further.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>You can easily spend a few hundred dollars \u003Ca href=\\\"https://digitalatar.com/cart.php?a=add&amp;domain=register\\\">finding the perfect domain\u003C/a>, building a website, and creating content, only to find your idea isn’t something you truly enjoy.\u003C/p>\u003Ch2 id=\\\"focus-on-customer-service-\\\">Focus on customer service.\u003C/h2>\u003Cp>Just like customer service matters at the grocery store and restaurant, it matters online.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Just like it’s easy to avoid proper planning, it’s easy to provide mediocre customer service online.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Amazon is the biggest online store in the world, but you know if you’ve ever tried to reach a customer service rep, customer service is not their priority. If you want to compete with the bigger players, providing above and beyond customer service that goes above and beyond will certainly help you.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>With so many of our business transactions happening over the Internet, it’s easy to forget that customers are people who are way more likely to return to your website if they have a good experience.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Your website should not feel like an empty spaceship—it looks cool, but also feels lonely.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>When you walk into a store, you expect someone to be there to greet you and answer any questions. It’s the same online. Even though you can’t reach through the screen to shake your customer’s hand, you can take steps to connect and communicate with them. This can be done through a live chat feature or an automated chatbot that can answer basic questions. You can send surveys to find out more about your customers wants and needs and provide a \u003Ca href=\\\"https://digitalatar.com/index.php?rp=/store/mail-service\\\">business email\u003C/a> and phone number for people to reach out.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>It’s also important to monitor your social media and reply to messages and comments. And check out customer reviews on Yelp, Google, and elsewhere to see who isn’t happy with their experience and make an effort to fix it.\u003C/p>\u003Ch2 id=\\\"validate-your-new-business-idea\\\">Validate your new business idea\u003C/h2>\u003Cp>You’ve probably seen at least a few of your friends start a new business venture, and then a month later...crickets.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>When you’re starting your new online business, you need to validate your idea. This is similar to planning your business, but validation requires other people’s honest opinions. You can create a business plan for something you love and are passionate about, but other people need to love the idea too, or else you have no potential customers.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Most people who are just getting started make the mistake of looking for a product first and the market second.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>To boost your chances of success, start with a market.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>The trick is to find a group of people who have a problem but not finding the right solution. Thankfully you don’t need to guess because the internet makes this kind of market research easy. People are always sharing their problems, and more often than not, they are willing to pay for a solution.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>You can search through Reddit and Quora forums or head over to Amazon and read reviews of similar products or services. There are plenty of resources that will tell you what problems people have and the pros and cons of current solutions.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>If you have a new idea, you should ask a few questions:\u003C/p>\u003Cul>\u003Cli>What problem does my idea solve?\u003C/li>\u003Cli>Who is experiencing this problem?\u003C/li>\u003Cli>What is the current solution?\u003C/li>\u003Cli>What are the pros and cons of the current solution?\u003C/li>\u003Cli>How will I differentiate my solution?\u003C/li>\u003C/ul>\u003Cp>Of course, there are plenty of other questions to ask when it comes to finding a viable business idea. Your next step towards validation is to talk to other people about your idea. Ask as many questions as you can. And, if possible, run pre-launch sales. There’s a huge difference between asking someone if your idea is good or interesting versus people paying you their hard-earned money.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Launching a new business is equally exciting and overwhelming. Don’t be afraid to make mistakes—mistakes are unavoidable. Just focus on putting one foot in front of the other while learning and applying every lesson the journey teaches you.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Remember- we can’t guarantee that your business will succeed. But, if you apply these tips and keep pressing forward, your chances of being in the 10% of online businesses that push past the first 120 days will increase significantly.\u003C/p>\",\"comment_id\":\"603fe7f837b9c22eb9a0a5eb\",\"feature_image\":\"https://blog.weblime.com/content/images/2022/02/tips-for-starting-an-online-business.png\",\"featured\":false,\"visibility\":\"public\",\"email_recipient_filter\":\"none\",\"created_at\":\"2021-03-03T14:48:08.000-05:00\",\"updated_at\":\"2022-02-14T10:30:59.000-05:00\",\"published_at\":\"2021-03-03T14:49:54.000-05:00\",\"custom_excerpt\":\"Starting an online business can feel overwhelming.
